CHAPTER I

It was four o’clock when the ceremony was over and the carriages began to arrive

Having the advantage of her in altitude, the driver had stood his ground and even ventured to attempt to speak; and the result had been a furious altercation, which, continuing all the way down Ashland Avenue, had added a new swarm of urchins to the cortege at each side street for half a mile

This was unfortunate, for already there was a throng before the door

Uzdaryk-duris._” in tones which made the orchestral uproar sound like fairy music

“Z

The reader, who perhaps has never held much converse in the language of far-off Lithuania, will be glad of the explanation that the place was the rear room of a saloon in that part of Chicago known as “back of the yards.” This information is definite and suited to the matter of fact; but how pitifully inadequate it would have seemed to one who understood that it was also the supreme hour of ecstasy in the life of one of God’s gentlest creatures, the scene of the wedding feast and the joy-transfiguration of little Ona Lukoszaite

She stood in the doorway, shepherded by Cousin Marija, breathless from pushing through the crowd, and in her happiness painful to look upon

She was so young—not quite sixteen—and small for her age, a mere child; and she had just been married—and married to Jurgis,[1] of all men, to Jurgis Rudkus, he with the white flower in the buttonhole of his new black suit, he with the mighty shoulders and the giant hands

[1] Pronounced _Yoorghis_

Ona was blue-eyed and fair, while Jurgis had great black eyes with beetling brows, and thick black hair that curled in waves about his ears—in short, they were one of those incongruous and impossible married couples with which Mother Nature so often wills to confound all prophets, before and after

Jurgis could take up a two-hundred-and-fifty-pound quarter of beef and carry it into a car without a stagger, or even a thought; and now he stood in a far corner, frightened as a hunted animal, and obliged to moisten his lips with his tongue each time before he could answer the congratulations of his friends

Gradually there was effected a separation between the spectators and the guests—a separation at least sufficiently complete for working purposes

Those who were still older, and could reach the tables, marched about munching contentedly at meat bones and bologna sausages

The room is about thirty feet square, with whitewashed walls, bare save for a calendar, a picture of a race horse, and a family tree in a gilded frame

In the corner to the left are the three musicians, upon a little platform, toiling heroically to make some impression upon the hubbub; also the babies, similarly occupied, and an open window whence the populace imbibes the sights and sounds and odors

Suddenly some of the steam begins to advance, and, peering through it, you discern Aunt Elizabeth, Ona’s stepmother—Teta Elzbieta, as they call her—bearing aloft a great platter of stewed duck

Graicziau._” screams Marija Berczynskas, and falls to work herself—for there is more upon the stove inside that will be spoiled if it be not eaten

So, with laughter and shouts and endless badinage and merriment, the guests take their places

And the children shout and the babies yell, and every one laughs and sings and chatters—while above all the deafening clamor Cousin Marija shouts orders to the musicians

The musicians—how shall one begin to describe them

It is the music which makes it what it is; it is the music which changes the place from the rear room of a saloon in back of the yards to a fairy place, a wonderland, a little corner of the high mansions of the sky

The little person who leads this trio is an inspired man

You can feel them in the air round about him, capering frenetically; with their invisible feet they set the pace, and the hair of the leader of the orchestra rises on end, and his eyeballs start from their sockets, as he toils to keep up with them

Tamoszius Kuszleika is his name, and he has taught himself to play the violin by practicing all night, after working all day on the “killing beds.” He is in his shirt sleeves, with a vest figured with faded gold horseshoes, and a pink-striped shirt, suggestive of peppermint candy

You wonder where he can have gotten them or rather you would wonder, if the excitement of being in his presence left you time to think of such things

For he is an inspired man

And every now and then he turns upon his companions, nodding, signaling, beckoning frantically—with every inch of him appealing, imploring, in behalf of the muses and their call

For they are hardly worthy of Tamoszius, the other two members of the orchestra

He is playing a bass part upon his cello, and so the excitement is nothing to him; no matter what happens in the treble, it is his task to saw out one long-drawn and lugubrious note after another, from four o’clock in the afternoon until nearly the same hour next morning, for his third of the total income of one dollar per hour

Before the feast has been five minutes under way, Tamoszius Kuszleika has risen in his excitement; a minute or two more and you see that he is beginning to edge over toward the tables

Finally all three are gathered at the foot of the tables, and there Tamoszius mounts upon a stool

Now he is in his glory, dominating the scene

During their progress, needless to say, the sounds of the cello are pretty well extinguished; but at last the three are at the head, and Tamoszius takes his station at the right hand of the bride and begins to pour out his soul in melting strains

Little Ona is too excited to eat

When in the end Tamoszius Kuszleika has reached her side, and is waving his magic wand above her, Ona’s cheeks are scarlet, and she looks as if she would have to get up and run away

In this crisis, however, she is saved by Marija Berczynskas, whom the muses suddenly visit

She wears a blue flannel shirt-waist, which is now rolled up at the sleeves, disclosing her brawny arms; she has a carving fork in her hand, with which she pounds on the table to mark the time

“Sudiev’ kvietkeli, tu brangiausis; Sudiev’ ir laime, man biednam, Matau—paskyre teip Aukszcziausis, Jog vargt ant svieto reik vienam.”

When the song is over, it is time for the speech, and old Dede Antanas rises to his feet

Now as he rises he is seized with a coughing fit, and holds himself by his chair and turns away his wan and battered face until it passes

Generally it is the custom for the speech at a _veselija_ to be taken out of one of the books and learned by heart; but in his youthful days Dede Antanas used to be a scholar, and really make up all the love letters of his friends

Jokubas possesses what his wife complacently describes as “poetiszka vaidintuve”—a poetical imagination

Now a good many of the guests have finished, and, since there is no pretense of ceremony, the banquet begins to break up

broom

The company pairs off quickly, and the whole room is soon in motion

Among these are Jokubas Szedvilas and his wife, Lucija, who together keep the delicatessen store, and consume nearly as much as they sell; they are too fat to dance, but they stand in the middle of the floor, holding each other fast in their arms, rocking slowly from side to side and grinning seraphically, a picture of toothless and perspiring ecstasy

Of these older people many wear clothing reminiscent in some detail of home—an embroidered waistcoat or stomacher, or a gaily colored handkerchief, or a coat with large cuffs and fancy buttons

There are learned people who can tell you out of the statistics that beef-boners make forty cents an hour, but, perhaps, these people have never looked into a beef-boner’s hands

When Tamoszius and his companions stop for a rest, as perforce they must, now and then, the dancers halt where they are and wait patiently

With a most wonderful rush he comes to the end of the tune, and flings up his hands and staggers back exhausted; and with a final shout of delight the dancers fly apart, reeling here and there, bringing up against the walls of the room

After this there is beer for every one, the musicians included, and the revelers take a long breath and prepare for the great event of the evening, which is the _acziavimas_

The guests are expected to pay for this entertainment; if they be proper guests, they will see that there is a neat sum left over for the bride and bridegroom to start life upon

Most fearful they are to contemplate, the expenses of this entertainment

And then to spend such a sum, all in a single day of your life, at a wedding feast

It is very imprudent, it is tragic—but, ah, it is so beautiful

Thus having known himself for the master of things, a man could go back to his toil and live upon the memory all his days

Endlessly the dancers swung round and round—when they were dizzy they swung the other way

Once every ten minutes or so they would fail to begin again, but instead would sink back exhausted; a circumstance which invariably brought on a painful and terrifying scene, that made the fat policeman stir uneasily in his sleeping place behind the door

It was all Marija Berczynskas

What are you paid for, children of hell.” And so, in sheer terror, the orchestra would strike up again, and Marija would return to her place and take up her task

She bore all the burden of the festivities now

There was a long rest for the orchestra, and plenty of refreshments, while Marija was making her peace with her victim, seating him upon the bar, and standing beside him and holding to his lips a foaming schooner of beer

In the meantime there was going on in another corner of the room an anxious conference between Teta Elzbieta and Dede Antanas, and a few of the more intimate friends of the family

Still others, worse yet, would crowd about the bar, and at the expense of the host drink themselves sodden, paying not the least attention to any one, and leaving it to be thought that either they had danced with the bride already, or meant to later on

All these things were going on now, and the family was helpless with dismay

The saloon-keeper stood in with all the big politics men in the district; and when you had once found out what it meant to get into trouble with such people, you would know enough to pay what you were told to pay and shut up

What made all this the more painful was that it was so hard on the few that had really done their best

As the frustrating of this one attempt involved a score of false alarms, it will be understood what a tribute old Mrs Jukniene brought, just because Teta Elzbieta had once loaned her some money for a few days and saved her from being turned out of her house

More and more friends gathered round while the lamentation about these things was going on

Now he said it a third time, and Ona drew a deep breath; it was so wonderful to have a husband, just like a grown woman—and a husband who could solve all problems, and who was so big and strong

The last sob of little Sebastijonas has been stifled, and the orchestra has once more been reminded of its duty

This makes it a cause for congratulation that by modern methods a very few men can do the painfully necessary work of head-cracking for the whole of the cultured world

There is no fight that night—perhaps because Jurgis, too, is watchful—even more so than the policeman

Fortunately, the policeman is disposed to be reasonable, and so it is not Marija who is flung out of the place

All this interrupts the music for not more than a minute or two

While there are so many who are anxious to work as you wish, there is no occasion for incommoding yourself with those who must work otherwise

Little Ona is nearly ready to faint—and half in a stupor herself, because of the heavy scent in the room

They live only two blocks away, and Jurgis does not care about the carriage

There is almost no farewell—the dancers do not notice them, and all of the children and many of the old folks have fallen asleep of sheer exhaustion

When he reaches home he is not sure whether she has fainted or is asleep, but when he has to hold her with one hand while he unlocks the door, he sees that she has opened her eyes

“You shall not go to Brown’s today, little one,” he whispers, as he climbs the stairs; and she catches his arm in terror, gasping: “No

I dare not

But he answers her again: “Leave it to me; leave it to me

CHAPTER II

Jurgis talked lightly about work, because he was young

He could not even imagine how it would feel to be beaten

Jurgis was like a boy, a boy from the country

Broken-down tramps and good-for-nothings, fellows who have spent all their money drinking, and want to get more for it

“It is plain,” they would answer to this, “that you have come from the country, and from very far in the country.” And this was the fact, for Jurgis had never seen a city, and scarcely even a fair-sized town, until he had set out to make his fortune in the world and earn his right to Ona

The sister was married, and her husband had bought the place when old Antanas had decided to go with his son

It was nearly a year and a half ago that Jurgis had met Ona, at a horse fair a hundred miles from home

In the fall, after the harvest was over, he saw that it would not do, and tramped the full fortnight’s journey that lay between him and Ona

He found an unexpected state of affairs—for the girl’s father had died, and his estate was tied up with creditors; Jurgis’ heart leaped as he realized that now the prize was within his reach

They would have had three times that, but it had gone to court, and the judge had decided against them, and it had cost the balance to get him to change his decision

Ona might have married and left them, but she would not, for she loved Teta Elzbieta

If one could only manage to get the price of a passage, he could count his troubles at an end

It was arranged that they should leave the following spring, and meantime Jurgis sold himself to a contractor for a certain time, and tramped nearly four hundred miles from home with a gang of men to work upon a railroad in Smolensk

When they paid him off he dodged the company gamblers and dramshops, and so they tried to kill him; but he escaped, and tramped it home, working at odd jobs, and sleeping always with one eye open

So in the summer time they had all set out for America

It was only at the age of twenty that it had occurred to Marija to try her strength, when she had risen up and nearly murdered the man, and then come away

There were twelve in all in the party, five adults and six children—and Ona, who was a little of both

The law says that the rate card shall be on the door of a hotel, but it does not say that it shall be in Lithuanian

It was in the stockyards that Jonas’ friend had gotten rich, and so to Chicago the party was bound

In the morning an interpreter was found, and they were taken and put upon a car, and taught a new word—“stockyards.” Their delight at discovering that they were to get out of this adventure without losing another share of their possessions it would not be possible to describe

They sat and stared out of the window

But after each of these interruptions, the desolate procession would begin again—the procession of dreary little buildings

A full hour before the party reached the city they had begun to note the perplexing changes in the atmosphere

There were some who drank it in as if it were an intoxicant; there were others who put their handkerchiefs to their faces

They were left standing upon the corner, staring; down a side street there were two rows of brick houses, and between them a vista: half a dozen chimneys, tall as the tallest of buildings, touching the very sky—and leaping from them half a dozen columns of smoke, thick, oily, and black as night

They spread in vast clouds overhead, writhing, curling; then, uniting in one giant river, they streamed away down the sky, stretching a black pall as far as the eye could reach

Then the party became aware of another strange thing

It was only by an effort that one could realize that it was made by animals, that it was the distant lowing of ten thousand cattle, the distant grunting of ten thousand swine

They would have liked to follow it up, but, alas, they had no time for adventures just then

To find that he had been making it in the delicatessen business was an extraordinary piece of good fortune at this juncture; though it was well on in the morning, they had not breakfasted, and the children were beginning to whimper

Thus was the happy ending to a woeful voyage

The last two days they had all but starved themselves—it made them quite sick to pay the prices that the railroad people asked them for food

Yet, when they saw the home of the Widow Jukniene they could not but recoil, even so, in all their journey they had seen nothing so bad as this

Very frequently a lodging house keeper would rent the same beds to double shifts of men

Mrs Jukniene was a wizened-up little woman, with a wrinkled face

One never saw the fields, nor any green thing whatever, in Packingtown; but one could go out on the road and “hobo it,” as the men phrased it, and see the country, and have a long rest, and an easy time riding on the freight cars

Such was the home to which the new arrivals were welcomed

They could get bedding at a secondhand store, she explained; and they would not need any, while the weather was so hot—doubtless they would all sleep on the sidewalk such nights as this, as did nearly all of her guests

Later that afternoon he and Ona went out to take a walk and look about them, to see more of this district which was to be their home

The most uncanny thing about this neighborhood was the number of the children; you thought there must be a school just out, and it was only after long acquaintance that you were able to realize that there was no school, but that these were the children of the neighborhood—that there were so many children to the block in Packingtown that nowhere on its streets could a horse and buggy move faster than a walk

It could not move faster anyhow, on account of the state of the streets

Was it not unhealthful

A little way farther on, and Jurgis and Ona, staring open-eyed and wondering, came to the place where this “made” ground was in process of making

Apparently none of them ever went down to find out

Beyond this dump there stood a great brickyard, with smoking chimneys

This held water, and all summer it stood there, with the near-by soil draining into it, festering and stewing in the sun; and then, when winter came, somebody cut the ice on it, and sold it to the people of the city

They stood there while the sun went down upon this scene, and the sky in the west turned blood-red, and the tops of the houses shone like fire

To the two who stood watching while the darkness swallowed it up, it seemed a dream of wonder, with its talc of human energy, of things being done, of employment for thousands upon thousands of men, of opportunity and freedom, of life and love and joy

CHAPTER III

In his capacity as delicatessen vender, Jokubas Szedvilas had many acquaintances

He had gone to Brown’s and stood there not more than half an hour before one of the bosses noticed his form towering above the rest, and signaled to him

“Speak English.”

“No; Lit-uanian.” (Jurgis had studied this word carefully.)

“Job.”

“Je.” (A nod.)

“Worked here before.”

“No ’stand.”

(Signals and gesticulations on the part of the boss

“Shovel guts.”

“No ’stand.” (More shakes of the head.)

“Zarnos

Pagaiksztis

“Je.”

“See door

“Je.”

“To-morrow, seven o’clock

Prieszpietys

“Dekui, tamistai.” (Thank you, sir.) And that was all

And he went all the way home as if upon wings, and burst into the house like a cyclone, to the rage of the numerous lodgers who had just turned in for their daily sleep

Meantime Jokubas had been to see his friend the policeman, and received encouragement, so it was a happy party

The packers might own the land, but he claimed the landscape, and there was no one to say nay to this

They passed down the busy street that led to the yards

Here they stood, staring, breathless with wonder

There is over a square mile of space in the yards, and more than half of it is occupied by cattle pens; north and south as far as the eye can reach there stretches a sea of pens

They were drovers and stock raisers, who had come from far states, and brokers and commission merchants, and buyers for all the big packing houses

Here and there they would stop to inspect a bunch of cattle, and there would be a parley, brief and businesslike

All night long this had been going on, and now the pens were full; by tonight they would all be empty, and the same thing would be done again

“And what will become of all these creatures.” cried Teta Elzbieta

“By tonight,” Jokubas answered, “they will all be killed and cut up; and over there on the other side of the packing houses are more railroad tracks, where the cars come to take them away.”

There were two hundred and fifty miles of track within the yards, their guide went on to tell them

The chutes into which the hogs went climbed high up—to the very top of the distant buildings; and Jokubas explained that the hogs went up by the power of their own legs, and then their weight carried them back through all the processes necessary to make them into pork

“They don’t waste anything here,” said the guide, and then he laughed and added a witticism, which he was pleased that his unsophisticated friends should take to be his own: “They use everything about the hog except the squeal.” In front of Brown’s General Office building there grows a tiny plot of grass, and this, you may learn, is the only bit of green thing in Packingtown; likewise this jest about the hog and his squeal, the stock in trade of all the guides, is the one gleam of humor that you will find there

After they had seen enough of the pens, the party went up the street, to the mass of buildings which occupy the center of the yards

Here was the headquarters of Durham’s Pure Leaf Lard, of Durham’s Breakfast Bacon, Durham’s Canned Beef, Potted Ham, Deviled Chicken, Peerless Fertilizer

Entering one of the Durham buildings, they found a number of other visitors waiting; and before long there came a guide, to escort them through the place

Here was the chute, with its river of hogs, all patiently toiling upward; there was a place for them to rest to cool off, and then through another passageway they went into a room from which there is no returning for hogs

It was a long, narrow room, with a gallery along it for visitors

So, as the wheel turned, a hog was suddenly jerked off his feet and borne aloft

At the same instant the car was assailed by a most terrifying shriek; the visitors started in alarm, the women turned pale and shrank back

It was too much for some of the visitors—the men would look at each other, laughing nervously, and the women would stand with hands clenched, and the blood rushing to their faces, and the tears starting in their eyes

Meantime, heedless of all these things, the men upon the floor were going about their work

There was a long line of hogs, with squeals and lifeblood ebbing away together; until at last each started again, and vanished with a splash into a huge vat of boiling water

It was all so very businesslike that one watched it fascinated

It was like some horrible crime committed in a dungeon, all unseen and unheeded, buried out of sight and of memory

One could not stand and watch very long without becoming philosophical, without beginning to deal in symbols and similes, and to hear the hog squeal of the universe

Who would take this hog into his arms and comfort him, reward him for his work well done, and show him the meaning of his sacrifice

The carcass hog was scooped out of the vat by machinery, and then it fell to the second floor, passing on the way through a wonderful machine with numerous scrapers, which adjusted themselves to the size and shape of the animal, and sent it out at the other end with nearly all of its bristles removed

At the end of this hog’s progress every inch of the carcass had been gone over several times; and then it was rolled into the chilling room, where it stayed for twenty-four hours, and where a stranger might lose himself in a forest of freezing hogs

Before the carcass was admitted here, however, it had to pass a government inspector, who sat in the doorway and felt of the glands in the neck for tuberculosis

This inspector wore a blue uniform, with brass buttons, and he gave an atmosphere of authority to the scene, and, as it were, put the stamp of official approval upon the things which were done in Durham’s

Jurgis went down the line with the rest of the visitors, staring open-mouthed, lost in wonder

Jurgis was vexed when the cynical Jokubas translated these signs with sarcastic comments, offering to take them to the secret rooms where the spoiled meats went to be doctored

The party descended to the next floor, where the various waste materials were treated

From the doors of these rooms went men with loaded trucks, to the platform where freight cars were waiting to be filled; and one went out there and realized with a start that he had come at last to the ground floor of this enormous building

Then the party went across the street to where they did the killing of beef—where every hour they turned four or five hundred cattle into meat

It was all in one great room, like a circus amphitheater, with a gallery for visitors running over the center

Along one side of the room ran a narrow gallery, a few feet from the floor; into which gallery the cattle were driven by men with goads which gave them electric shocks

Then once more the gates were opened, and another lot rushed in; and so out of each pen there rolled a steady stream of carcasses, which the men upon the killing beds had to get out of the way

The manner in which they did this was something to be seen and never forgotten

This floor was half an inch deep with blood, in spite of the best efforts of men who kept shoveling it through holes; it must have made the floor slippery, but no one could have guessed this by watching the men at work

The carcass hung for a few minutes to bleed; there was no time lost, however, for there were several hanging in each line, and one was always ready

In the end, as with the hogs, the finished beef was run into the chilling room, to hang its appointed time

The visitors were taken there and shown them, all neatly hung in rows, labeled conspicuously with the tags of the government inspectors—and some, which had been killed by a special process, marked with the sign of the kosher rabbi, certifying that it was fit for sale to the orthodox

It sent its products to every country in the civilized world, and it furnished the food for no less than thirty million people

To all of these things our friends would listen open-mouthed—it seemed to them impossible of belief that anything so stupendous could have been devised by mortal man

So guileless was he, and ignorant of the nature of business, that he did not even realize that he had become an employee of Brown’s, and that Brown and Durham were supposed by all the world to be deadly rivals—were even required to be deadly rivals by the law of the land, and ordered to try to ruin each other under penalty of fine and imprisonment

CHAPTER IV

Promptly at seven the next morning Jurgis reported for work

He was paid the fabulous sum of seventeen and a half cents an hour; and as it proved a rush day and he worked until nearly seven o’clock in the evening, he went home to the family with the tidings that he had earned more than a dollar and a half in a single day

At home, also, there was more good news; so much of it at once that there was quite a celebration in Aniele’s hall bedroom

The painting of cans being skilled piecework, and paying as much as two dollars a day, Marija burst in upon the family with the yell of a Comanche Indian, and fell to capering about the room so as to frighten the baby almost into convulsions

Better luck than all this could hardly have been hoped for; there was only one of them left to seek a place

The oldest of them, little Stanislovas, was but thirteen, and small for his age at that; and while the oldest son of Szedvilas was only twelve, and had worked for over a year at Jones’s, Jurgis would have it that Stanislovas should learn to speak English, and grow up to be a skilled man

So there was only old Dede Antanas; Jurgis would have had him rest too, but he was forced to acknowledge that this was not possible, and, besides, the old man would not hear it spoken of—it was his whim to insist that he was as lively as any boy

They had not told this to old Anthony, who had consequently spent the two days wandering about from one part of the yards to another, and had now come home to hear about the triumph of the others, smiling bravely and saying that it would be his turn another day

Their good luck, they felt, had given them the right to think about a home; and sitting out on the doorstep that summer evening, they held consultation about it, and Jurgis took occasion to broach a weighty subject

At noontime a man with whom he had been talking had read it to him and told him a little about it, with the result that Jurgis had conceived a wild idea

He brought out the placard, which was quite a work of art

Perhaps the translator found it a difficult matter to be sentimental in a language in which a sob is known as a gukcziojimas and a smile as a nusiszypsojimas

Over this document the family pored long, while Ona spelled out its contents

If they paid rent, of course, they might pay forever, and be no better off; whereas, if they could only meet the extra expense in the beginning, there would at last come a time when they would not have any rent to pay for the rest of their lives

They figured it up

Jurgis was at a loss to understand why, with wages as they were, so many of the people of this district should live the way they did

The next day Marija went to see her “forelady,” and was told to report the first of the week, and learn the business of can-painter

So it had finally been arranged—and they were to go and make an inspection the following Sunday morning

That was Thursday; and all the rest of the week the killing gang at Brown’s worked at full pressure, and Jurgis cleared a dollar seventy-five every day

So they would have eighty-five dollars a month—or, supposing that Dede Antanas did not get work at once, seventy dollars a month—which ought surely to be sufficient for the support of a family of twelve

An hour before the time on Sunday morning the entire party set out

To press the matter would have seemed to be doubting his word, and never in their lives had any one of them ever spoken to a person of the class called “gentleman” except with deference and humility

The house had a basement, about two feet below the street line, and a single story, about six feet above it, reached by a flight of steps

After a discovery such as that it would have seemed ungrateful to find any fault, and so they tried to shut their eyes to other defects

Still, they were peasant people, and they hung on to their money by instinct; it was quite in vain that the agent hinted at promptness—they would see, they would see, they told him, they could not decide until they had had more time

Which, of course, reopened the subject

The controlling factor was that they could not stay where they were—they had to go somewhere

So he told them, and so in the end the decision was made

They had talked about looking at more houses before they made the purchase; but then they did not know where any more were, and they did not know any way of finding out

They drew a deep breath when he told them that they were still in time

They were to come on the morrow, and he would have the papers all drawn up

Jurgis spent a whole evening impressing upon them the seriousness of the occasion—and then finally, out of innumerable hiding places about their persons and in their baggage, came forth the precious wads of money, to be done up tightly in a little bag and sewed fast in the lining of Teta Elzbieta’s dress

Early in the morning they sallied forth

It was hard to tell, with all this strange legal jargon, words he had never heard before; but was not this plain—“the party of the first part hereby covenants and agrees to rent to the said party of the second part.” And then again—“a monthly _rental_ of twelve dollars, for a period of eight years and four months.” Then Szedvilas took off his spectacles, and looked at the agent, and stammered a question

The agent was most polite, and explained that that was the usual formula; that it was always arranged that the property should be merely rented

Elzbieta had firmly fixed in her mind the last solemn warning of Jurgis: “If there is anything wrong, do not give him the money, but go out and get a lawyer.” It was an agonizing moment, but she sat in the chair, her hands clenched like death, and made a fearful effort, summoning all her powers, and gasped out her purpose

Jokubas translated her words

They were so weak from fright that they could not walk, but had to sit down on the way

So they went home, with a deadly terror gnawing at their souls; and that evening Jurgis came home and heard their story, and that was the end

His companion explained the situation, and the lawyer took the paper and began to read it, while Jurgis stood clutching the desk with knotted hands, trembling in every nerve

Once or twice the lawyer looked up and asked a question of Szedvilas; the other did not know a word that he was saying, but his eyes were fixed upon the lawyer’s face, striving in an agony of dread to read his mind

He saw the lawyer look up and laugh, and he gave a gasp; the man said something to Szedvilas, and Jurgis turned upon his friend, his heart almost stopping

“Well.” he panted

“He says it is all right,” said Szedvilas

“All right.”

“Yes, he says it is just as it should be.” And Jurgis, in his relief, sank down into a chair

“Are you sure of it.” he gasped, and made Szedvilas translate question after question

But he had had such a horrible fright; strong man as he was, it left him almost too weak to stand up

The lawyer explained that the rental was a form—the property was said to be merely rented until the last payment had been made, the purpose being to make it easier to turn the party out if he did not make the payments

So long as they paid, however, they had nothing to fear, the house was all theirs

Jurgis was so grateful that he paid the half dollar the lawyer asked without winking an eyelash, and then rushed home to tell the news to the family

It was hours before the excitement could be calmed; and all through that cruel night Jurgis would wake up now and then and hear Ona and her stepmother in the next room, sobbing softly to themselves

CHAPTER V

They had bought their home

They had to make some shift to furnish it, and every instant of their leisure was given to discussing this

A person who had such a task before him would not need to look very far in Packingtown—he had only to walk up the avenue and read the signs, or get into a streetcar, to obtain full information as to pretty much everything a human creature could need

“Go and get the Goliath Bunion Cure.” “Get a move on you.” would chime in another

Among these importunate signs was one that had caught the attention of the family by its pictures

One of the plates in the set had been found broken when they unpacked it, and Ona was going to the store the first thing in the morning to make them change it; also they had promised three saucepans, and there had only two come, and did Jurgis think that they were trying to cheat them

The next day they went to the house; and when the men came from work they ate a few hurried mouthfuls at Aniele’s, and then set to work at the task of carrying their belongings to their new home

They were going to be married as soon as they could get everything settled, and a little spare money put by; and this was to be their home—that little room yonder would be theirs

It was in truth a never-ending delight, the fixing up of this house

The nest which had been advertised had not included feathers for quite so many birds as there were in this family

They had, of course, put their dining table in the kitchen, and the dining room was used as the bedroom of Teta Elzbieta and five of her children

She would have ready a great pot full of steaming black coffee, and oatmeal and bread and smoked sausages; and then she would fix them their dinner pails with more thick slices of bread with lard between them—they could not afford butter—and some onions and a piece of cheese, and so they would tramp away to work

This was the first time in his life that he had ever really worked, it seemed to Jurgis; it was the first time that he had ever had anything to do which took all he had in him

This was called “speeding up the gang,” and if any man could not keep up with the pace, there were hundreds outside begging to try

Yet Jurgis did not mind it; he rather enjoyed it

It was not the pleasantest work one could think of, but it was necessary work; and what more had a man the right to ask than a chance to do something useful, and to get good pay for doing it

So Jurgis thought, and so he spoke, in his bold, free way; very much to his surprise, he found that it had a tendency to get him into trouble

Women and little children would fall to cursing about it; it was rotten, rotten as hell—everything was rotten

One of the first problems that Jurgis ran upon was that of the unions

Jurgis had not studied the books, and he would not have known how to pronounce “laissez faire”; but he had been round the world enough to know that a man has to shift for himself in it, and that if he gets the worst of it, there is nobody to listen to him holler

Yet there have been known to be philosophers and plain men who swore by Malthus in the books, and would, nevertheless, subscribe to a relief fund in time of a famine

He had been likewise to all the stores and saloons for a mile about, begging for some little thing to do; and everywhere they had ordered him out, sometimes with curses, and not once even stopping to ask him a question

So, after all, there was a crack in the fine structure of Jurgis’ faith in things as they are

Antanas had asked; to which the man had replied that that was nobody’s business, but that he could do what he said

Jurgis had made some friends by this time, and he sought one of them and asked what this meant

It must have been old Durham in the beginning; it was a heritage which the self-made merchant had left to his son, along with his millions

Jurgis would find out these things for himself, if he stayed there long enough; it was the men who had to do all the dirty jobs, and so there was no deceiving them; and they caught the spirit of the place, and did like all the rest

That man who had been sent to Jurgis’ father by the boss, _he_ would rise; the man who told tales and spied upon his fellows would rise; but the man who minded his own business and did his work—why, they would “speed him up” till they had worn him out, and then they would throw him into the gutter

Jurgis went home with his head buzzing

And yet so many strange things kept coming to Jurgis’ notice every day

He tried to persuade his father to have nothing to do with the offer

Except that it was damp and dark, it was not an unpleasant job, in summer

Now Antanas Rudkus was the meekest man that God ever put on earth; and so Jurgis found it a striking confirmation of what the men all said, that his father had been at work only two days before he came home as bitter as any of them, and cursing Durham’s with all the power of his soul

This floor was filthy, yet they set Antanas with his mop slopping the “pickle” into a hole that connected with a sink, where it was caught and used over again forever; and if that were not enough, there was a trap in the pipe, where all the scraps of meat and odds and ends of refuse were caught, and every few days it was the old man’s task to clean these out, and shovel their contents into one of the trucks with the rest of the meat

This was the experience of Antanas; and then there came also Jonas and Marija with tales to tell

It was not fit work for a woman, handling fourteen-pound cans all day

It was a striking circumstance that Jonas, too, had gotten his job by the misfortune of some other person

Therefore these trucks went for the most part on the run; and the predecessor of Jonas had been jammed against the wall by one and crushed in a horrible and nameless manner

All of these were sinister incidents; but they were trifles compared to what Jurgis saw with his own eyes before long

So in a trice the carcass of the cow would be cleaned out, and entrails would have vanished; it was Jurgis’ task to slide them into the trap, calves and all, and on the floor below they took out these “slunk” calves, and butchered them for meat, and used even the skins of them

One day a man slipped and hurt his leg; and that afternoon, when the last of the cattle had been disposed of, and the men were leaving, Jurgis was ordered to remain and do some special work which this injured man had usually done

When he came home that night he was in a very somber mood, having begun to see at last how those might be right who had laughed at him for his faith in America

CHAPTER VI

Jurgis and Ona were very much in love; they had waited a long time—it was now well into the second year, and Jurgis judged everything by the criterion of its helping or hindering their union

Even the tricks and cruelties he saw at Durham’s had little meaning for him just then, save as they might happen to affect his future with Ona

The marriage would have been at once, if they had had their way; but this would mean that they would have to do without any wedding feast, and when they suggested this they came into conflict with the old people

The piece was beautiful on the parlor mantel, and one could not have a home without some sort of ornament

The cost of the wedding feast would, of course, be returned to them; but the problem was to raise it even temporarily

They were just beginning to adjust themselves to this necessity, when out of the clear sky there fell a thunderbolt upon them—a calamity that scattered all their hopes to the four winds

About a block away from them there lived another Lithuanian family, consisting of an elderly widow and one grown son; their name was Majauszkis, and our friends struck up an acquaintance with them before long

Grandmother Majauszkiene had lived in the midst of misfortune so long that it had come to be her element, and she talked about starvation, sickness, and death as other people might about weddings and holidays

The thing came gradually

They had fooled the company, however, for her son was a skilled man, who made as high as a hundred dollars a month, and as he had had sense enough not to marry, they had been able to pay for the house

Grandmother Majauszkiene saw that her friends were puzzled at this remark; they did not quite see how paying for the house was “fooling the company.” Evidently they were very inexperienced

She would tell them a little about it

The first family had been Germans

Grandmother Majauszkiene was a socialist, or some such strange thing; another son of hers was working in the mines of Siberia, and the old lady herself had made speeches in her time—which made her seem all the more terrible to her present auditors

They called her back to the story of the house

But he had been killed in an elevator accident in Durham’s

Then there had come the Irish, and there had been lots of them, too; the husband drank and beat the children—the neighbors could hear them shrieking any night

He had gone all to ruin with the drink, however, and lost his power; one of his sons, who was a good man, had kept him and the family up for a year or two, but then he had got sick with consumption

That was another thing, Grandmother Majauszkiene interrupted herself—this house was unlucky

Very often a man could get no work in Packingtown for months, while a child could go and get a place easily; there was always some new machine, by which the packers could get as much work out of a child as they had been able to get out of a man, and for a third of the pay

To come back to the house again, it was the woman of the next family that had died

Then the children had been taken away, and the company had sold the house that very same week to a party of emigrants

So this grim old woman went on with her tale of horrors

It seemed to shake him all over, and it never stopped; you could see a red stain wherever he had spit upon the floor

And yet all these things were as nothing to what came a little later

Then they stared at her

“Interest.” they cried

“Interest on the money you still owe,” she answered

“But we don’t have to pay any interest.” they exclaimed, three or four at once

And for this she laughed at them

They never sell the houses without interest

Then, with a horrible sinking of the heart, Teta Elzbieta unlocked her bureau and brought out the paper that had already caused them so many agonies

Now they sat round, scarcely breathing, while the old lady, who could read English, ran over it

And there followed a dead silence

“What does that mean.” asked Jurgis finally, almost in a whisper

“That means,” replied the other, “that you have to pay them seven dollars next month, as well as the twelve dollars.”

Then again there was not a sound

Ai

All their outcry did them no good, of course

But it was in the deed, and that was all that was necessary, as they would find when the time came

Somehow or other they got rid of their guest, and then they passed a night of lamentation

He had not told them, simply because he had supposed they would understand that they had to pay interest upon their debt, as a matter of course

So they came away, and Ona went down to the yards, and at noontime saw Jurgis and told him

Previously Jurgis had scouted this idea, but now knit his brows and nodded his head slowly—yes, perhaps it would be best; they would all have to make some sacrifices now

So Ona set out that day to hunt for work; and at night Marija came home saying that she had met a girl named Jasaityte who had a friend that worked in one of the wrapping rooms in Brown’s, and might get a place for Ona there; only the forelady was the kind that takes presents—it was no use for any one to ask her for a place unless at the same time they slipped a ten-dollar bill into her hand

So in the end Ona, with a ten-dollar bill burning a hole in her palm, had another interview with the forelady

Meantime Teta Elzbieta had taken Stanislovas to the priest and gotten a certificate to the effect that he was two years older than he was; and with it the little boy now sallied forth to make his fortune in the world

To attend to all this and fill several hundred cans of lard per hour, there were necessary two human creatures, one of whom knew how to place an empty lard can on a certain spot every few seconds, and the other of whom knew how to take a full lard can off a certain spot every few seconds and set it upon a tray

And so, after little Stanislovas had stood gazing timidly about him for a few minutes, a man approached him, and asked what he wanted, to which Stanislovas said, “Job.” Then the man said “How old.” and Stanislovas answered, “Sixtin.” Once or twice every year a state inspector would come wandering through the packing plants, asking a child here and there how old he was; and so the packers were very careful to comply with the law, which cost them as much trouble as was now involved in the boss’s taking the document from the little boy, and glancing at it, and then sending it to the office to be filed away

And for this, at the end of the week, he would carry home three dollars to his family, being his pay at the rate of five cents per hour—just about his proper share of the total earnings of the million and three-quarters of children who are now engaged in earning their livings in the United States

And meantime, because they were young, and hope is not to be stifled before its time, Jurgis and Ona were again calculating; for they had discovered that the wages of Stanislovas would a little more than pay the interest, which left them just about as they had been before

It would be but fair to them to say that the little boy was delighted with his work, and at the idea of earning a lot of money; and also that the two were very much in love with each other

CHAPTER VII

All summer long the family toiled, and in the fall they had money enough for Jurgis and Ona to be married according to home traditions of decency

In the latter part of November they hired a hall, and invited all their new acquaintances, who came and left them over a hundred dollars in debt

It was a bitter and cruel experience, and it plunged them into an agony of despair

They wondered if ever any love that had blossomed in the world had been so crushed and trampled

Over them, relentless and savage, there cracked the lash of want; the morning after the wedding it sought them as they slept, and drove them out before daybreak to work

All that day he stood at his lard machine, rocking unsteadily, his eyes closing in spite of him; and he all but lost his place even so, for the foreman booted him twice to waken him

It was fully a week before they were all normal again, and meantime, with whining children and cross adults, the house was not a pleasant place to live in

It was true that more things were going on at this time in the mind of Jurgis than ever had in all his life before

He had to protect her, to do battle for her against the horror he saw about them

The great corporation which employed you lied to you, and lied to the whole country—from top to bottom it was nothing but one gigantic lie

So Jurgis said that he understood it; and yet it was really pitiful, for the struggle was so unfair—some had so much the advantage

Ona had an idea that her “forelady” did not like to have her girls marry—perhaps because she was old and ugly and unmarried herself

There were many such dangers, in which the odds were all against them

Upon being asked what the difference was, the man had wound up the first halfway and the second all the way, and showed the customer how the latter made twice as much noise; upon which the customer remarked that he was a sound sleeper, and had better take the more expensive clock

There is a poet who sings that

“Deeper their heart grows and nobler their bearing, Whose youth in the fires of anguish hath died.”

But it was not likely that he had reference to the kind of anguish that comes with destitution, that is so endlessly bitter and cruel, and yet so sordid and petty, so ugly, so humiliating—unredeemed by the slightest touch of dignity or even of pathos

The family, having no idea of this, and no more money to throw away, had nothing to do but give up and submit to one more misery for the rest of their days

Then there was old Antanas

For twenty-five years old Antanas Rudkus and his son had dwelt in the forest together, and it was hard to part in this way; perhaps it was just as well that Jurgis had to give all his attention to the task of having a funeral without being bankrupted, and so had no time to indulge in memories and grief

Now the dreadful winter was come upon them

Sooner or later came the day when the unfit one did not report for work; and then, with no time lost in waiting, and no inquiries or regrets, there was a chance for a new hand

The new hands were here by the thousands

Then Durham’s bosses picked out twenty of the biggest; the “two hundred” proved to have been a printer’s error

Four or five miles to the eastward lay the lake, and over this the bitter winds came raging

They would wrap up in all they owned, but they could not wrap up against exhaustion; and many a man gave out in these battles with the snowdrifts, and lay down and fell asleep

And if it was bad for the men, one may imagine how the women and children fared

Sometimes Jurgis would be working until late at night, and then it was pitiful, for there was no place for the little fellow to wait, save in the doorways or in a corner of the killing beds, and he would all but fall asleep there, and freeze to death

There was no heat upon the killing beds; the men might exactly as well have worked out of doors all winter

Also the air would be full of steam, from the hot water and the hot blood, so that you could not see five feet before you; and then, with men rushing about at the speed they kept up on the killing beds, and all with butcher knives, like razors, in their hands—well, it was to be counted as a wonder that there were not more men slaughtered than cattle

And yet all this inconvenience they might have put up with, if only it had not been for one thing—if only there had been some place where they might eat

To the west of the yards ran Ashland Avenue, and here was an unbroken line of saloons—“Whiskey Row,” they called it; to the north was Forty-seventh Street, where there were half a dozen to the block, and at the angle of the two was “Whiskey Point,” a space of fifteen or twenty acres, and containing one glue factory and about two hundred saloons

One might walk among these and take his choice: “Hot pea-soup and boiled cabbage today.” “Sauerkraut and hot frankfurters

As if to complete the chain, the packers all paid their men in checks, refusing all requests to pay in coin; and where in Packingtown could a man go to have his check cashed but to a saloon, where he could pay for the favor by spending a part of the money

From all of these things Jurgis was saved because of Ona

And so on until morning—when they would go out to another day of toil, a little weaker, a little nearer to the time when it would be their turn to be shaken from the tree

CHAPTER VIII

Yet even by this deadly winter the germ of hope was not to be kept from sprouting in their hearts

It was just at this time that the great adventure befell Marija

The victim was Tamoszius Kuszleika, who played the violin

A wonderful privilege it was to be thus admitted into the soul of a man of genius, to be allowed to share the ecstasies and the agonies of his inmost life

Then there were other benefits accruing to Marija from this friendship—benefits of a more substantial nature

She was compelled, at these parties, to spend most of her time at the refreshment table, for she could not dance with anybody except other women and very old men; Tamoszius was of an excitable temperament, and afflicted with a frantic jealousy, and any unmarried man who ventured to put his arm about the ample waist of Marija would be certain to throw the orchestra out of tune

It was a great help to a person who had to toil all the week to be able to look forward to some such relaxation as this on Saturday nights

Some people would have scorned this talk as gossip; but then one has to talk about what one knows

It was one Saturday night, as they were coming home from a wedding, that Tamoszius found courage, and set down his violin case in the street and spoke his heart; and then Marija clasped him in her arms

After that he no longer made love to her with his fiddle, but they would sit for hours in the kitchen, blissfully happy in each other’s arms; it was the tacit convention of the family to know nothing of what was going on in that corner

They were planning to be married in the spring, and have the garret of the house fixed up, and live there

Marija felt, so to speak, that she had her hand on the throttle, and the neighborhood was vocal with her rejoicings

Yet her friends would shake their heads and tell her to go slow; one could not count upon such good fortune forever—there were accidents that always happened

But Marija was not to be prevailed upon, and went on planning and dreaming of all the treasures she was going to have for her home; and so, when the crash did come, her grief was painful to see

For her canning factory shut down

And that was all that there was to it—her job was gone

It was the holiday rush that was over, the girls said in answer to Marija’s inquiries; after that there was always a slack

It was all a swindle, can-painting, said the girls—you were crazy with delight because you were making twelve or fourteen dollars a week, and saving half of it; but you had to spend it all keeping alive while you were out, and so your pay was really only half what you thought

Marija came home, and because she was a person who could not rest without danger of explosion, they first had a great house cleaning, and then she set out to search Packingtown for a job to fill up the gap

Then she took to trying the stores and saloons, and when this failed she even traveled over into the far-distant regions near the lake front, where lived the rich people in great palaces, and begged there for some sort of work that could be done by a person who did not know English

The men upon the killing beds felt also the effects of the slump which had turned Marija out; but they felt it in a different way, and a way which made Jurgis understand at last all their bitterness

And then suddenly the place would spring into activity, and the merciless “speeding-up” would begin

There were weeks at a time when Jurgis went home after such a day as this with not more than two hours’ work to his credit—which meant about thirty-five cents

And so on Christmas Eve Jurgis worked till nearly one o’clock in the morning, and on Christmas Day he was on the killing bed at seven o’clock

All this was bad; and yet it was not the worst

This was a savage witticism the men had, which Jurgis had to have explained to him

One of the consequences of all these things was that Jurgis was no longer perplexed when he heard men talk of fighting for their rights

For fully a week they were quite blissfully happy, thinking that belonging to a union meant an end to all their troubles

But only ten days after she had joined, Marija’s canning factory closed down, and that blow quite staggered them

Quite apart from her own troubles she was boiling over with a general sense of the injustice of it, and she told what she thought of the packers, and what she thought of a world where such things were allowed to happen; and then, while the echoes of the hall rang with the shock of her terrible voice, she sat down again and fanned herself, and the meeting gathered itself together and proceeded to discuss the election of a recording secretary

Jurgis too had an adventure the first time he attended a union meeting, but it was not of his own seeking

In the end one of the men, seeing his plight, came over and rescued him; but it was some time before he was able to find any one to explain things to him, and meanwhile his fear lest the strange little Irishman should get him cornered again was enough to keep him dodging about the room the whole evening

He never missed a meeting, however

He forgot how he himself had been blind, a short time ago—after the fashion of all crusaders since the original ones, who set out to spread the gospel of Brotherhood by force of arms

CHAPTER IX

One of the first consequences of the discovery of the union was that Jurgis became desirous of learning English

They were teaching him both to read and to speak English—and they would have taught him other things, if only he had had a little time

Also the union made another great difference with him—it made him begin to pay attention to the country

He found that here, precisely as in Russia, there were rich men who owned everything; and if one could not find any work, was not the hunger he began to feel the same sort of hunger

When Jurgis had been working about three weeks at Brown’s, there had come to him one noontime a man who was employed as a night watchman, and who asked him if he would not like to take out naturalization papers and become a citizen

So each man in turn took an oath of which he did not understand a word, and then was presented with a handsome ornamented document with a big red seal and the shield of the United States upon it, and was told that he had become a citizen of the Republic and the equal of the President himself

A month or two later Jurgis had another interview with this same man, who told him where to go to “register.” And then finally, when election day came, the packing houses posted a notice that men who desired to vote might remain away until nine that morning, and the same night watchman took Jurgis and the rest of his flock into the back room of a saloon, and showed each of them where and how to mark a ballot, and then gave each two dollars, and took them to the polling place, where there was a policeman on duty especially to see that they got through all right

Jurgis felt quite proud of this good luck till he got home and met Jonas, who had taken the leader aside and whispered to him, offering to vote three times for four dollars, which offer had been accepted

And now in the union Jurgis met men who explained all this mystery to him; and he learned that America differed from Russia in that its government existed under the form of a democracy

The city inspector of sidewalks was a barkeeper at the War Whoop Cafe—and maybe he could make it uncomfortable for any tradesman who did not stand in with Scully

Even the packers were in awe of him, so the men said

The banks of “Bubbly Creek” are plastered thick with hairs, and this also the packers gather and clean

And there were things even stranger than this, according to the gossip of the men

There was said to be two thousand dollars a week hush money from the tubercular steers alone; and as much again from the hogs which had died of cholera on the trains, and which you might see any day being loaded into boxcars and hauled away to a place called Globe, in Indiana, where they made a fancy grade of lard

[2] Rules and Regulations for the Inspection of Livestock and Their Products

Such rejected or condemned animals shall at once be   removed by the owners from the pens containing animals which have   been inspected and found to be free from disease and fit for human   food, and _shall be disposed of in accordance with the laws,   ordinances, and regulations of the state and municipality in which   said rejected or condemned animals are located_...

Section 25

A microscopic examination for trichinae shall be made   of all swine products exported to countries requiring such   examination

Jurgis heard of these things little by little, in the gossip of those who were obliged to perpetrate them

It was stuff such as this that made the “embalmed beef” that had killed several times as many United States soldiers as all the bullets of the Spaniards; only the army beef, besides, was not fresh canned, it was old stuff that had been lying for years in the cellars

Then one Sunday evening, Jurgis sat puffing his pipe by the kitchen stove, and talking with an old fellow whom Jonas had introduced, and who worked in the canning rooms at Durham’s; and so Jurgis learned a few things about the great and only Durham canned goods, which had become a national institution

Any day, however, one might see sharp-horned and shaggy-haired creatures running with the sheep and yet what a job you would have to get the public to believe that a good part of what it buys for lamb and mutton is really goat’s flesh

There was another interesting set of statistics that a person might have gathered in Packingtown—those of the various afflictions of the workers

And the wandering visitor might be skeptical about all the swindles, but he could not be skeptical about these, for the worker bore the evidence of them about on his own person—generally he had only to hold out his hand

There were the men in the pickle rooms, for instance, where old Antanas had gotten his death; scarce a one of these that had not some spot of horror on his person

These people could not be shown to the visitor,—for the odor of a fertilizer man would scare any ordinary visitor at a hundred yards, and as for the other men, who worked in tank rooms full of steam, and in some of which there were open vats near the level of the floor, their peculiar trouble was that they fell into the vats; and when they were fished out, there was never enough of them left to be worth exhibiting,—sometimes they would be overlooked for days, till all but the bones of them had gone out to the world as Durham’s Pure Leaf Lard

CHAPTER X

During the early part of the winter the family had had money enough to live and a little over to pay their debts with; but when the earnings of Jurgis fell from nine or ten dollars a week to five or six, there was no longer anything to spare

So Jurgis and Ona and Teta Elzbieta would hold anxious conferences until late at night, trying to figure how they could manage this too without starving

Such were the cruel terms upon which their life was possible, that they might never have nor expect a single instant’s respite from worry, a single instant in which they were not haunted by the thought of money

They were willing to work all the time; and when people did their best, ought they not to be able to keep alive

There seemed never to be an end to the things they had to buy and to the unforeseen contingencies

The sewer would cost them about twenty-two dollars, and the sidewalk fifteen if it were wood, twenty-five if it were cement

So Jurgis went home again; it was a relief to know the worst, at any rate, so that he could no more be surprised by fresh demands

They could only go on and make the fight and win—for defeat was a thing that could not even be thought of

When the springtime came, they were delivered from the dreadful cold, and that was a great deal; but in addition they had counted on the money they would not have to pay for coal—and it was just at this time that Marija’s board began to fail

There was no escaping; you might provide all your doors and windows with screens, but their buzzing outside would be like the swarming of bees, and whenever you opened the door they would rush in as if a storm of wind were driving them

Perhaps the summertime suggests to you thoughts of the country, visions of green fields and mountains and sparkling lakes

Perhaps this was due to the repulsiveness of the work; at any rate, the people who worked with their hands were a class apart, and were made to feel it

In the late spring the canning factory started up again, and so once more Marija was heard to sing, and the love-music of Tamoszius took on a less melancholy tone

Just one year and three days after she had begun work as a can-painter, she lost her job

It was a long story

In the end she sat down in the middle of the floor and wept and wailed

It was a cruel lesson; but then Marija was headstrong—she should have listened to those who had had experience

The next time she would know her place, as the forelady expressed it; and so Marija went out, and the family faced the problem of an existence again

It was especially hard this time, for Ona was to be confined before long, and Jurgis was trying hard to save up money for this

The cheapest doctor they could find would charge them fifteen dollars, and perhaps more when the bill came in; and here was Jurgis, declaring that he would pay it, even if he had to stop eating in the meantime

Marija had only about twenty-five dollars left

All the family learned it along with her—that when you have once got a job in Packingtown, you hang on to it, come what will

Four weeks Marija hunted, and half of a fifth week

She had about made up her mind that she was a lost soul, when somebody told her of an opening, and she went and got a place as a “beef-trimmer.” She got this because the boss saw that she had the muscles of a man, and so he discharged a man and put Marija to do his work, paying her a little more than half what he had been paying before

When she first came to Packingtown, Marija would have scorned such work as this

But day by day the music of Tamoszius’ violin became more passionate and heartbreaking; and Marija would sit with her hands clasped and her cheeks wet and all her body a-tremble, hearing in the wailing melodies the voices of the unborn generations which cried out in her for life

Marija’s lesson came just in time to save Ona from a similar fate

She understood now that the real reason that Miss Henderson hated her was that she was a decent married girl; and she knew that the talebearers and the toadies hated her for the same reason, and were doing their best to make her life miserable

But there was no place a girl could go in Packingtown, if she was particular about things of this sort; there was no place in it where a prostitute could not get along better than a decent girl

Things that were quite unspeakable went on there in the packing houses all the time, and were taken for granted by everybody; only they did not show, as in the old slavery times, because there was no difference in color between master and slave

One morning Ona stayed home, and Jurgis had the man-doctor, according to his whim, and she was safely delivered of a fine baby

Jurgis would stand and gaze at the stranger by the hour, unable to believe that it had really happened

The coming of this boy was a decisive event with Jurgis

It was sufficiently perplexing that this tiny mite of life should have come into the world at all in the manner that it had; that it should have come with a comical imitation of its father’s nose was simply uncanny

Perhaps, Jurgis thought, this was intended to signify that it was his baby; that it was his and Ona’s, to care for all its life

It took him quite a while to get over his alarm at the incredible shortness of the little creature’s legs

Jurgis had, alas, very little time to see his baby; he never felt the chains about him more than just then

And this indeed had been the first thing that Jurgis had thought of himself—he had clenched his hands and braced himself anew for the struggle, for the sake of that tiny mite of human possibility

And so Ona went back to Brown’s and saved her place and a week’s wages; and so she gave herself some one of the thousand ailments that women group under the title of “womb trouble,” and was never again a well person as long as she lived

As these all contained alcohol, or some other stimulant, she found that they all did her good while she took them; and so she was always chasing the phantom of good health, and losing it because she was too poor to continue

CHAPTER XI

During the summer the packing houses were in full activity again, and Jurgis made more money

The men were to teach new hands, who would some day come and break their strike; and meantime they were kept so poor that they could not prepare for the trial

But let no one suppose that this superfluity of employees meant easier work for any one

At the end of it the girl who had carried the red flag went downtown and got a position in a great department store, at a salary of two dollars and a half a week

Jurgis and Ona heard these stories with dismay, for there was no telling when their own time might come

Jurgis was told that they also fixed the price they would pay for beef on the hoof and the price of all dressed meat in the country; but that was something he did not understand or care about

The only one who was not afraid of a cut was Marija, who congratulated herself, somewhat naïvely, that there had been one in her place only a short time before she came

Tamoszius had a bank account also, and they ran a race, and began to figure upon household expenses once more

The possession of vast wealth entails cares and responsibilities, however, as poor Marija found out

Jurgis made fun of her for this, for he was a man and was proud of his superior knowledge, telling her that the bank had fireproof vaults, and all its millions of dollars hidden safely away in them

However, one morning Marija took her usual detour, and, to her horror and dismay, saw a crowd of people in front of the bank, filling the avenue solid for half a block

This was fortunate for her, for a few minutes later the police reserves arrived

In half an hour Marija was back, Teta Elzbieta with her, both of them breathless with running and sick with fear

At nine o’clock the bank opened and began to pay the waiting throng; but then, what good did that do Marija, who saw three thousand people before her—enough to take out the last penny of a dozen banks

To make matters worse a drizzling rain came up, and soaked them to the skin; yet all the morning they stood there, creeping slowly toward the goal—all the afternoon they stood there, heartsick, seeing that the hour of closing was coming, and that they were going to be left out

Toward evening Jurgis came; he had heard the story from the children, and he brought some food and dry wraps, which made it a little easier

The next morning, before daybreak, came a bigger crowd than ever, and more policemen from downtown

Weighted this way she made her way to the yards, again in fear, this time to see if she had lost her place; but fortunately about ten per cent of the working people of Packingtown had been depositors in that bank, and it was not convenient to discharge that many at once

About this time Jurgis and Ona also began a bank account

However, as every one did it, and his refusal to join would not have made the slightest difference in the results, the idea of refusing would have seemed absurd, had it ever come into his head

Now chill winds and shortening days began to warn them that the winter was coming again

And suppose that some day when a blizzard struck them and the cars were not running, Ona should have to give up, and should come the next day to find that her place had been given to some one who lived nearer and could be depended on

It was the week before Christmas that the first storm came, and then the soul of Jurgis rose up within him like a sleeping lion

Once it was eleven o’clock at night, and black as the pit, but still they got home

That blizzard knocked many a man out, for the crowd outside begging for work was never greater, and the packers would not wait long for any one

When it was over, the soul of Jurgis was a song, for he had met the enemy and conquered, and felt himself the master of his fate.—So it might be with some monarch of the forest that has vanquished his foes in fair fight, and then falls into some cowardly trap in the night-time

A time of peril on the killing beds was when a steer broke loose

And then, to cap the climax, the floor boss would come rushing up with a rifle and begin blazing away

It was in one of these mêlées that Jurgis fell into his trap

The injury was not one that Durham and Company could be held responsible for, and so that was all there was to it, so far as the doctor was concerned

Jurgis got home somehow, scarcely able to see for the pain, and with an awful terror in his soul, Elzbieta helped him into bed and bandaged his injured foot with cold water and tried hard not to let him see her dismay; when the rest came home at night she met them outside and told them, and they, too, put on a cheerful face, saying it would only be for a week or two, and that they would pull him through

When they had gotten him to sleep, however, they sat by the kitchen fire and talked it over in frightened whispers

And then little Stanislovas began to whimper—who would take care of him

It was dreadful that an accident of this sort, that no man can help, should have meant such suffering

It was true, it was true,—that here in this huge city, with its stores of heaped-up wealth, human creatures might be hunted down and destroyed by the wild-beast powers of nature, just as truly as ever they were in the days of the cave men

Ona was now making about thirty dollars a month, and Stanislovas about thirteen

Because the account was in her name, it was possible for her to keep this a secret from her husband, and to keep the heartsickness of it for her own

It would have been better if Jurgis had been really ill; if he had not been able to think

These were dreadful times, for Jurgis would get as cross as any bear; he was scarcely to be blamed, for he had enough to worry him, and it was hard when he was trying to take a nap to be kept awake by noisy and peevish children

Elzbieta’s only resource in those times was little Antanas; indeed, it would be hard to say how they could have gotten along at all if it had not been for little Antanas

He does, he does

CHAPTER XII

For three weeks after his injury Jurgis never got up from bed

Two of the men had to help him to the car, and when he got out he had to sit down and wait in the snow till some one came along

So they put him to bed again, and sent for the doctor, as they ought to have done in the beginning

When finally the doctor left, he told him that he would have to lie quiet for two months, and that if he went to work before that time he might lame himself for life

Three days later there came another heavy snowstorm, and Jonas and Marija and Ona and little Stanislovas all set out together, an hour before daybreak, to try to get to the yards

Ona was quite certain that she would find her place gone, and was all unnerved when she finally got to Brown’s, and found that the forelady herself had failed to come, and was therefore compelled to be lenient

One of the consequences of this episode was that the first joints of three of the little boy’s fingers were permanently disabled, and another that thereafter he always had to be beaten before he set out to work, whenever there was fresh snow on the ground

They say that the best dog will turn cross if he be kept chained all the time, and it was the same with the man; he had not a thing to do all day but lie and curse his fate, and the time came when he wanted to curse everything

This was never for very long, however, for when Ona began to cry, Jurgis could not stay angry

About the end of March he had got hold of Ona’s bankbook, and learned that there was only three dollars left to them in the world

But perhaps the worst of the consequences of this long siege was that they lost another member of their family; Brother Jonas disappeared

And now the winter was over, and the spring winds were blowing—and with a day’s walk a man might put the smoke of Packingtown behind him forever, and be where the grass was green and the flowers all the colors of the rainbow

But now the income of the family was cut down more than one-third, and the food demand was cut only one-eleventh, so that they were worse off than ever

Poor Tamoszius was a man without any relatives, and with a wonderful talent besides, and he ought to have made money and prospered; but he had fallen in love, and so given hostages to fortune, and was doomed to be dragged down too

So it was finally decided that two more of the children would have to leave school

Fortunately, however, they had already sold some papers, and came back with nearly as much as they started with

After a week of mishaps such as these, the two little fellows began to learn the ways of the trade—the names of the different papers, and how many of each to get, and what sort of people to offer them to, and where to go and where to stay away from

And besides, the companies were thieves, people said—had stolen all their franchises with the help of scoundrelly politicians

Now that the winter was by, and there was no more danger of snow, and no more coal to buy, and another room warm enough to put the children into when they cried, and enough money to get along from week to week with, Jurgis was less terrible than he had been

Poor Jurgis, who had in truth grown more matter-of-fact, under the endless pressure of penury, would not know what to make of these things, and could only try to recollect when he had last been cross; and so Ona would have to forgive him and sob herself to sleep

The latter part of April Jurgis went to see the doctor, and was given a bandage to lace about his ankle, and told that he might go back to work

Then he went out and took his place with the mob of the unemployed

This time, however, Jurgis did not have the same fine confidence, nor the same reason for it

He must have a place again and some money saved up, before the next winter came

But there was no work for him

Then there was nothing more for him to do but go with the crowd in the morning, and keep in the front row and look eager, and when he failed, go back home, and play with little Kotrina and the baby

The peculiar bitterness of all this was that Jurgis saw so plainly the meaning of it

Two years was the “statute of limitations,” and after that the victim could not sue

What happened to a man after any of these things, all depended upon the circumstances

An unmarried man could save, if he did not drink, and if he was absolutely selfish—that is, if he paid no heed to the demands of his old parents, or of his little brothers and sisters, or of any other relatives he might have, as well as of the members of his union, and his chums, and the people who might be starving to death next door

CHAPTER XIII

During this time that Jurgis was looking for work occurred the death of little Kristoforas, one of the children of Teta Elzbieta

For his mother, with unnatural perversity, loved him best of all her children, and made a perpetual fuss over him—would let him do anything undisturbed, and would burst into tears when his fretting drove Jurgis wild

And now he died

Elzbieta, alas, did not read the papers, and no one had told her; but perhaps it was as well, for just then they would not have had the carfare to spare to go every day to wait upon the surgeon, nor for that matter anybody with the time to take the child

All this while that he was seeking for work, there was a dark shadow hanging over Jurgis; as if a savage beast were lurking somewhere in the pathway of his life, and he knew it, and yet could not help approaching the place

There is a place that waits for the lowest man—the fertilizer plant

The men would talk about it in awe-stricken whispers

He was a man, and he would do his duty; he went and made application—but surely he was not also required to hope for success

The fertilizer works of Durham’s lay away from the rest of the plant

He would go in like a man swimming under water; he would put his handkerchief over his face, and begin to cough and choke; and then, if he were still obstinate, he would find his head beginning to ring, and the veins in his forehead to throb, until finally he would be assailed by an overpowering blast of ammonia fumes, and would turn and run for his life, and come out half-dazed

On top of this were the rooms where they dried the “tankage,” the mass of brown stringy stuff that was left after the waste portions of the carcasses had had the lard and tallow dried out of them

In Packingtown the fertilizer is pure, instead of being a flavoring, and instead of a ton or so spread out on several acres under the open sky, there are hundreds and thousands of tons of it in one building, heaped here and there in haystack piles, covering the floor several inches deep, and filling the air with a choking dust that becomes a blinding sandstorm when the wind stirs

It was to this building that Jurgis came daily, as if dragged by an unseen hand

The month of May was an exceptionally cool one, and his secret prayers were granted; but early in June there came a record-breaking hot spell, and after that there were men wanted in the fertilizer mill

The boss of the grinding room had come to know Jurgis by this time, and had marked him for a likely man; and so when he came to the door about two o’clock this breathless hot day, he felt a sudden spasm of pain shoot through him—the boss beckoned to him

Here was one more difficulty for him to meet and conquer

His labor took him about one minute to learn

The building had to be left open, and when the wind blew Durham and Company lost a great deal of fertilizer

Working in his shirt sleeves, and with the thermometer at over a hundred, the phosphates soaked in through every pore of Jurgis’ skin, and in five minutes he had a headache, and in fifteen was almost dazed

A man could get used to the fertilizer mill, the boss had said, if he would make up his mind to it; but Jurgis now began to see that it was a question of making up his stomach

At the end of that day of horror, he could scarcely stand

Jurgis only knew that a man in front of him immediately got up and gave him a seat; and that half a minute later the two people on each side of him got up; and that in a full minute the crowded car was nearly empty—those passengers who could not get room on the platform having gotten out to walk

Of course Jurgis had made his home a miniature fertilizer mill a minute after entering

He smelled so that he made all the food at the table taste, and set the whole family to vomiting; for himself it was three days before he could keep anything upon his stomach—he might wash his hands, and use a knife and fork, but were not his mouth and throat filled with the poison

And still Jurgis stuck it out

And so at the end of the week he was a fertilizer man for life—he was able to eat again, and though his head never stopped aching, it ceased to be so bad that he could not work

So there passed another summer

But Jurgis declared that from this to ceasing to come at all would not be a very long step, and so it was decided that Vilimas and Nikalojus should return to school in the fall, and that instead Elzbieta should go out and get some work, her place at home being taken by her younger daughter

Little Kotrina was like most children of the poor, prematurely made old; she had to take care of her little brother, who was a cripple, and also of the baby; she had to cook the meals and wash the dishes and clean house, and have supper ready when the workers came home in the evening

Elzbieta was used to working, but she found this change a hard one, for the reason that she had to stand motionless upon her feet from seven o’clock in the morning till half-past twelve, and again from one till half-past five

The men and women who worked in this department were precisely the color of the “fresh country sausage” they made

The sausage-room was an interesting place to visit, for two or three minutes, and provided that you did not look at the people; the machines were perhaps the most wonderful things in the entire plant

It was piecework, and she was apt to have a family to keep alive; and stern and ruthless economic laws had arranged it that she could only do this by working just as she did, with all her soul upon her work, and with never an instant for a glance at the well-dressed ladies and gentlemen who came to stare at her, as at some wild beast in a menagerie

CHAPTER XIV

With one member trimming beef in a cannery, and another working in a sausage factory, the family had a first-hand knowledge of the great majority of Packingtown swindles

With what had been told them by Jonas, who had worked in the pickle rooms, they could now study the whole of the spoiled-meat industry on the inside, and read a new and grim meaning into that old Packingtown jest—that they use everything of the pig except the squeal

Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose

After this invention there was no longer Number One, Two, and Three Grade—there was only Number One Grade

It was only when the whole ham was spoiled that it came into the department of Elzbieta

All of their sausage came out of the same bowl, but when they came to wrap it they would stamp some of it “special,” and for this they would charge two cents more a pound

Such were the new surroundings in which Elzbieta was placed, and such was the work she was compelled to do

They were so numbed that they did not even suffer much from hunger, now; only the children continued to fret when the food ran short

Yet the soul of Ona was not dead—the souls of none of them were dead, but only sleeping; and now and then they would waken, and these were cruel times

It was a thing scarcely to be spoken—a thing never spoken by all the world, that will not know its own defeat

They were beaten; they had lost the game, they were swept aside

It was as if their hopes were buried in separate graves

Jurgis, being a man, had troubles of his own

Jurgis had discovered drink

He was working in the steaming pit of hell; day after day, week after week—until now, there was not an organ of his body that did its work without pain, until the sound of ocean breakers echoed in his head day and night, and the buildings swayed and danced before him as he went down the street

His dead self would stir in him, and he would find himself laughing and cracking jokes with his companions—he would be a man again, and master of his life

It was not an easy thing for Jurgis to take more than two or three drinks

Afterward, when he saw the despair of his family, and reckoned up the money he had spent, the tears came into his eyes, and he began the long battle with the specter

It was a battle that had no end, that never could have one

They might drink together, and escape from the horror—escape for a while, come what would

So there came a time when nearly all the conscious life of Jurgis consisted of a struggle with the craving for liquor

As for Jurgis, he was expected to bring home every penny; he could not even go with the men at noontime—he was supposed to sit down and eat his dinner on a pile of fertilizer dust

This was not always his mood, of course; he still loved his family

He was burning up with fever, and his eyes were running sores; in the daytime he was a thing uncanny and impish to behold, a plaster of pimples and sweat, a great purple lump of misery

Yet all this was not really as cruel as it sounds, for, sick as he was, little Antanas was the least unfortunate member of that family

Antanas was but little over a year old, and already no one but his father could manage him

It seemed as if he had taken all of his mother’s strength—had left nothing for those that might come after him

Ona was with child again now, and it was a dreadful thing to contemplate; even Jurgis, dumb and despairing as he was, could not but understand that yet other agonies were on the way, and shudder at the thought of them

For Ona was visibly going to pieces

So she would lie and sob out her grief upon his shoulder, while he gazed at her, as helpless as a wounded animal, the target of unseen enemies

CHAPTER XV

The beginning of these perplexing things was in the summer; and each time Ona would promise him with terror in her voice that it would not happen again—but in vain

But he never thought of it, except when he was dragged to it—he lived like a dumb beast of burden, knowing only the moment in which he was

The winter was coming on again, more menacing and cruel than ever

If they should fail, they would certainly be lost; if they held out, they might have enough coal for the winter

A day or two before Thanksgiving Day there came a snowstorm

And it was bitter cold, and a foot of snow on the ground

Jurgis sat up with a start

In the few seconds that he stood there hesitating he was covered white

He set off at a run for the yards, stopping by the way to inquire in the saloons that were open

At the time office, which he found already open, the clerk told him that Ona’s check had been turned in the night before, showing that she had left her work

After that there was nothing for him to do but wait, pacing back and forth in the snow, meantime, to keep from freezing

Jurgis took up his stand by the time-office window, where alone there was light enough for him to see; the snow fell so quick that it was only by peering closely that he could make sure that Ona did not pass him

Seven o’clock came, the hour when the great packing machine began to move

It was she, running swiftly; as she saw him, she staggered forward, and half fell into his outstretched arms

“What has been the matter.” he cried, anxiously

It was several seconds before she could get breath to answer him

“I couldn’t get home,” she exclaimed

“But where were you then.” he demanded

“I had to go home with a friend,” she panted—“with Jadvyga.”

Jurgis drew a deep breath; but then he noticed that she was sobbing and trembling—as if in one of those nervous crises that he dreaded so

“But what’s the matter.” he cried

“Oh, Jurgis, I was so frightened.” she said, clinging to him wildly

They were near the time station window, and people were staring at them

“How do you mean.” he asked, in perplexity

“I was afraid—I was just afraid.” sobbed Ona

I tried to get home, but I was so tired

He was so glad to get her back that he could not think clearly about anything else

He let her cry away her tears; and then, because it was nearly eight o’clock, and they would lose another hour if they delayed, he left her at the packing house door, with her ghastly white face and her haunted eyes of terror

There was another brief interval

Christmas was almost come; and because the snow still held, and the searching cold, morning after morning Jurgis half carried his wife to her post, staggering with her through the darkness; until at last, one night, came the end

It lacked but three days of the holidays

Something more serious must be wrong this time

They aroused Jurgis, and he sat up and listened crossly to the story

Jurgis turned over in his bed, and was snoring again before the two had closed the door

In the morning, however, he was up and out nearly an hour before the usual time

The door of the room was in the rear, reached by a narrow court, and Jurgis saw a light in the window and heard something frying as he passed; he knocked, half expecting that Ona would answer

Instead there was one of Jadvyga’s little sisters, who gazed at him through a crack in the door

“Ona.” she said

“Yes,” said Jurgis, “isn’t she here.”

“No,” said the child, and Jurgis gave a start

When she saw who it was, she slid around out of sight, for she was not quite dressed

“Ona isn’t here.” Jurgis demanded, too alarmed to wait for her to finish

“Why, no,” said Jadvyga

“What made you think she would be here

“No,” he answered

“As before.” echoed Jadvyga, in perplexity

“The time she spent the night here,” said Jurgis

“There must be some mistake,” she answered, quickly

He was only half able to realize the words

Jadvyga

“There must be some mistake,” declared the girl, again; “she didn’t come here.”

He steadied himself by the door-sill; and Jadvyga in her anxiety—for she was fond of Ona—opened the door wide, holding her jacket across her throat

“She must have meant somewhere else

“She said here,” insisted Jurgis

You haven’t forgotten

“No, no.” she exclaimed—and then came a peevish voice—“Jadvyga, you are giving the baby a cold

Shut the door.” Jurgis stood for half a minute more, stammering his perplexity through an eighth of an inch of crack; and then, as there was really nothing more to be said, he excused himself and went away

He walked on half dazed, without knowing where he went

He could hardly grasp the thing—much less try to solve it; but a hundred wild surmises came to him, a sense of impending calamity overwhelmed him

Because there was nothing else to do, he went back to the time office to watch again

Then a man came up, wheeling a truck; he knew Jurgis for Ona’s husband, and was curious about the mystery

“Maybe the cars had something to do with it,” he suggested—“maybe she had gone down-town.”

“No,” said Jurgis, “she never went down-town.”

“Perhaps not,” said the man

Jurgis thought he saw him exchange a swift glance with the girl as he spoke, and he demanded quickly

But the man had seen that the boss was watching him; he started on again, pushing his truck

“I don’t know anything about it,” he said, over his shoulder

Then Jurgis went out again and paced up and down before the building

Finally, toward the middle of the afternoon, he set out for home once more

He was walking out Ashland Avenue

The sight of them set Jurgis to thinking again of the man’s sarcastic remark; and half involuntarily he found himself watching the cars—with the result that he gave a sudden startled exclamation, and stopped short in his tracks

Then he broke into a run

He slowed down, and let the car go on

She got out: and as soon as she was out of sight on the side street Jurgis broke into a run

Then he went home and entered

As he opened the door, he saw Elzbieta, who had also been looking for Ona, and had come home again

Jurgis waited until she was close to him

“Don’t make any noise,” she whispered, hurriedly

“What’s the matter’.” he asked

I’m afraid her mind’s been wandering, Jurgis

“When did she come in.” he asked

“Soon after you left this morning,” said Elzbieta

“And has she been out since.”

“No, of course not

And he set his teeth hard together

“You are lying to me,” he said

Elzbieta started, and turned pale

“Why.” she gasped

But Jurgis did not answer

He pushed her aside, and strode to the bedroom door and opened it

Ona was sitting on the bed

“Where have you been.” he demanded

She had her hands clasped tightly in her lap, and he saw that her face was as white as paper, and drawn with pain

I started to come last night, and I could not find the way

“You needed a rest,” he said, in a hard tone

He was looking her fairly in the face, and he could read the sudden fear and wild uncertainty that leaped into her eyes

“You are lying to me,” said Jurgis

“Why do you lie to me.” he cried, fiercely

“Jurgis.” she exclaimed, starting up in fright

“You have lied to me, I say.” he cried

You had been where you were last night—somewheres downtown, for I saw you get off the car

It was as if he had struck a knife into her

She caught herself at the side of the bed, and then sank down, burying her face in her hands and bursting into frantic weeping

There came one of those hysterical crises that had so often dismayed him

“Go out.” he cried, “go out.” And then, as she stood hesitating, about to speak, he seized her by the arm, and half flung her from the room, slamming the door and barring it with a table

Yet she did not hear him—she was still in the grip of the fiend

Jurgis bore it until he could bear it no longer, and then he sprang at her, seizing her by the shoulders and shaking her, shouting into her ear: “Stop it, I say

She looked up at him, out of her agony; then she fell forward at his feet

She caught them in her hands, in spite of his efforts to step aside, and with her face upon the floor lay writhing

This time she heeded him, and caught her breath and lay silent, save for the gasping sobs that wrenched all her frame

Suddenly, however, he heard her voice, faintly: “Jurgis

“What is it.” he said

He had to bend down to her, she was so weak

She was pleading with him, in broken phrases, painfully uttered: “Have faith in me

“Believe what.” he cried

“Believe that I—that I know best—that I love you

Oh, Jurgis, please, please

He started to speak again, but she rushed on frantically, heading him off

It wasn’t my fault—I couldn’t help it—it will be all right—it is nothing—it is no harm

She had hold of him, and was trying to raise herself to look at him; he could feel the palsied shaking of her hands and the heaving of the bosom she pressed against him

She managed to catch one of his hands and gripped it convulsively, drawing it to her face, and bathing it in her tears

But still she clung to him, wailing aloud in her despair: “Oh, Jurgis, think what you are doing

We can be happy—we can love each other just the same

Her words fairly drove him wild

“Answer me,” he cried

She sank down upon the floor, beginning to cry again

It was like listening to the moan of a damned soul, and Jurgis could not stand it

She began to scream aloud, her voice like the voice of some wild beast: “Ah

I can’t

“Why can’t you do it.” he shouted

“I don’t know how.”

He sprang and caught her by the arm, lifting her up, and glaring into her face

“Tell me where you were last night.” he panted

Then she began to whisper, one word at a time: “I—was in—a house—downtown—”

“What house

She tried to hide her eyes away, but he held her

He caught himself against the wall, and put his hand to his forehead, staring about him, and whispering, “Jesus

An instant later he leaped at her, as she lay groveling at his feet

“Quick

She tried to get away, making him furious; he thought it was fear, of the pain of his clutch—he did not understand that it was the agony of her shame

“Connor,” he gasped

“The boss,” she answered

He tightened his grip, in his frenzy, and only when he saw her eyes closing did he realize that he was choking her

His breath beat hot into her face

“Tell me,” he whispered, at last, “tell me about it.”

She lay perfectly motionless, and he had to hold his breath to catch her words

I only did it—to save us

Again, for a space, there was no sound but his panting

We could never get anything to do—here—again

Jurgis’ arms were shaking so that he could scarcely hold himself up, and lurched forward now and then as he listened

“When—when did this begin.” he gasped

“At the very first,” she said

He would hound us to death, he said—then he said if I would—if I—we would all of us be sure of work—always

“Where was this.”

“In the hallway—at night—after every one had gone

I thought of you—of the baby—of mother and the children

A moment ago her face had been ashen gray, now it was scarlet

Jurgis made not a sound

“That was two months ago

He kicked me—last night—too

All this she had said without a quiver; she lay still as death, not an eyelid moving

The instant his feet were on the sidewalk he broke into a run

He ran like one possessed, blindly, furiously, looking neither to the right nor left

Within his soul it was like a roaring furnace; he stood waiting, waiting, crouching as if for a spring

He had some of his breath back when the car came to the entrance of the yards, and so he leaped off and started again, racing at full speed

He looked for the man as he sprang into the room

The truckmen were hard at work, loading the freshly packed boxes and barrels upon the cars

In an instant more he fronted the boss

He was a big, red-faced Irishman, coarse-featured, and smelling of liquor

The next moment he was on top of him, burying his fingers in his throat

To Jurgis this man’s whole presence reeked of the crime he had committed; the touch of his body was madness to him—it set every nerve of him a-tremble, it aroused all the demon in his soul

Things swam blood before him, and he screamed aloud in his fury, lifting his victim and smashing his head upon the floor

The place, of course, was in an uproar; women fainting and shrieking, and men rushing in

In a flash he had bent down and sunk his teeth into the man’s cheek; and when they tore him away he was dripping with blood, and little ribbons of skin were hanging in his mouth

They got him down upon the floor, clinging to him by his arms and legs, and still they could hardly hold him

In the end, by their sheer weight, they choked the breath out of him, and then they carried him to the company police station, where he lay still until they had summoned a patrol wagon to take him away

CHAPTER XVI

When Jurgis got up again he went quietly enough

It would be nothing unusual if he got his skull cracked in the mêlée—in which case they would report that he had been drunk and had fallen down, and there would be no one to know the difference or to care

So a barred door clanged upon Jurgis and he sat down upon a bench and buried his face in his hands

He was alone; he had the afternoon and all of the night to himself

At first he was like a wild beast that has glutted itself; he was in a dull stupor of satisfaction

It would not help to feed her and her child; she would certainly lose her place, while he—what was to happen to him God only knew

Half the night he paced the floor, wrestling with this nightmare; and when he was exhausted he lay down, trying to sleep, but finding instead, for the first time in his life, that his brain was too much for him

The air was fetid with their breath, yet in spite of this some of them smelled Jurgis and called down the torments of hell upon him, while he lay in a far corner of his cell, counting the throbbings of the blood in his forehead

They had brought him his supper, which was “duffers and dope”—being hunks of dry bread on a tin plate, and coffee, called “dope” because it was drugged to keep the prisoners quiet

Toward morning the place fell silent, and he got up and began to pace his cell; and then within the soul of him there rose up a fiend, red-eyed and cruel, and tore out the strings of his heart

It was not for himself that he suffered—what did a man who worked in Durham’s fertilizer mill care about anything that the world might do to him

And now—oh, it could not be true; it was too monstrous, too horrible

It was a thing that could not be faced; a new shuddering seized him every time he tried to think of it

The shame of it would kill her—there could be no other deliverance, and it was best that she should die

This was simple and clear, and yet, with cruel inconsistency, whenever he escaped from this nightmare it was to suffer and cry out at the vision of Ona starving

It was their one hope of respite, as long as they lived; they had put all their money into it—and they were working people, poor people, whose money was their strength, the very substance of them, body and soul, the thing by which they lived and for lack of which they died

And they would lose it all; they would be turned out into the streets, and have to hide in some icy garret, and live or die as best they could

Would they be allowed to see him—or was it to be part of his punishment to be kept in ignorance about their fate

His mind would hang upon the worst possibilities; he saw Ona ill and tortured, Marija out of her place, little Stanislovas unable to get to work for the snow, the whole family turned out on the street

They did not advertise their activities, having more calls than they could attend to without that

—So on until morning

In front, upon a raised platform behind a rail, sat a stout, florid-faced personage, with a nose broken out in purple blotches

Our friend realized vaguely that he was about to be tried

Yet he had picked up gossip enough to have it occur to him that the loud-voiced man upon the bench might be the notorious Justice Callahan, about whom the people of Packingtown spoke with bated breath

“Pat” Callahan—“Growler” Pat, as he had been known before he ascended the bench—had begun life as a butcher boy and a bruiser of local reputation; he had gone into politics almost as soon as he had learned to talk, and had held two offices at once before he was old enough to vote

“Growler” Pat had given up holding city offices very early in his career—caring only for party power, and giving the rest of his time to superintending his dives and brothels

Jurgis sat gazing about the room for an hour or two; he was in hopes that some one of the family would come, but in this he was disappointed

Connor was under the doctor’s care, the lawyer explained briefly, and if his Honor would hold the prisoner for a week—“Three hundred dollars,” said his Honor, promptly

Jurgis was staring from the judge to the lawyer in perplexity

They took him to a room where other prisoners were waiting and here he stayed until court adjourned, when he had another long and bitterly cold ride in a patrol wagon to the county jail, which is on the north side of the city, and nine or ten miles from the stockyards

Here they searched Jurgis, leaving him only his money, which consisted of fifteen cents

The prisoners roomed two in a cell, but that day there was one left over, and he was the one

The cells were in tiers, opening upon galleries

When Jurgis lifted up the mattress he discovered beneath it a layer of scurrying roaches, almost as badly frightened as himself

Here they brought him more “duffers and dope,” with the addition of a bowl of soup

They cut him and bruised him—they were cold and merciless as the men who had built them

In the distance there was a church-tower bell that tolled the hours one by one

And they seemed to waken the city—all around, far and near, there were bells, ringing wild music; for fully a minute Jurgis lay lost in wonder, before, all at once, the meaning of it broke over him—that this was Christmas Eve

Christmas Eve—he had forgotten it entirely

The last time they had had a big basket with them and all their Christmas marketing to do—a roast of pork and a cabbage and some rye bread, and a pair of mittens for Ona, and a rubber doll that squeaked, and a little green cornucopia full of candy to be hung from the gas jet and gazed at by half a dozen pairs of longing eyes

Even half a year of the sausage machines and the fertilizer mill had not been able to kill the thought of Christmas in them; there was a choking in Jurgis’ throat as he recalled that the very night Ona had not come home Teta Elzbieta had taken him aside and shown him an old valentine that she had picked up in a paper store for three cents—dingy and shopworn, but with bright colors, and figures of angels and doves

Why at least had they not left him alone—why, after they had shut him in jail, must they be ringing Christmas chimes in his ears

But no, their bells were not ringing for him—their Christmas was not meant for him, they were simply not counting him at all

That was their law, that was their justice

Jurgis stood upright; trembling with passion, his hands clenched and his arms upraised, his whole soul ablaze with hatred and defiance

Would any man in his senses have trapped a wild thing in its lair, and left its young behind to die

These midnight hours were fateful ones to Jurgis; in them was the beginning of his rebellion, of his outlawry and his unbelief

And every hour his soul grew blacker, every hour he dreamed new dreams of vengeance, of defiance, of raging, frenzied hate

The vilest deeds, like poison weeds,   Bloom well in prison air; It is only what is good in Man   That wastes and withers there; Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,   And the Warder is Despair

So wrote a poet, to whom the world had dealt its justice—

I know not whether Laws be right,   Or whether Laws be wrong; All that we know who lie in gaol   Is that the wall is strong

And they do well to hide their hell,   For in it things are done That Son of God nor son of Man   Ever should look upon

CHAPTER XVII

At seven o’clock the next morning Jurgis was let out to get water to wash his cell—a duty which he performed faithfully, but which most of the prisoners were accustomed to shirk, until their cells became so filthy that the guards interposed

At one side of the court was a place for visitors, cut off by two heavy wire screens, a foot apart, so that nothing could be passed in to the prisoners; here Jurgis watched anxiously, but there came no one to see him

Soon after he went back to his cell, a keeper opened the door to let in another prisoner

He nodded to Jurgis, and then, as the keeper closed the door upon him, began gazing critically about him

“Well, pal,” he said, as his glance encountered Jurgis again, “good morning.”

“Good morning,” said Jurgis

“A rum go for Christmas, eh.” added the other

Jurgis nodded

The newcomer went to the bunks and inspected the blankets; he lifted up the mattress, and then dropped it with an exclamation

He glanced at Jurgis again

“Looks as if it hadn’t been slept in last night

“I didn’t want to sleep last night,” said Jurgis

“When did you come in.”

“Yesterday.”

The other had another look around, and then wrinkled up his nose

“There’s the devil of a stink in here,” he said, suddenly

“It’s me,” said Jurgis

“You.”

“Yes, me.”

“Didn’t they make you wash.”

“Yes, but this don’t wash.”

“What is it.”

“Fertilizer.”

“Fertilizer

The deuce

“I work in the stockyards—at least I did until the other day

“That’s a new one on me,” said the newcomer

“I thought I’d been up against ‘em all

“I hit my boss.”

“Oh—that’s it

“He—he treated me mean.”

“I see

“What are you.” Jurgis asked

“I.” The other laughed

“They say I’m a cracksman,” he said

“What’s that.” asked Jurgis

“Safes, and such things,” answered the other

“Oh,” said Jurgis, wonderingly, and stared at the speaker in awe

“Yes,” laughed the other, “that’s what they say.”

He did not look to be over twenty-two or three, though, as Jurgis found afterward, he was thirty

“Is that what you’re here for.” Jurgis inquired

“No,” was the answer

They were mad because they couldn’t get any evidence

“What’s your name.” the young fellow continued after a pause

What with women and wine and the excitement of his vocation, a man could afford to rest now and then

Naturally, the aspect of prison life was changed for Jurgis by the arrival of a cell mate

He was not always victorious, but then defeat did not mean annihilation, and need not break his spirit

Withal he was a goodhearted fellow—too much so, it appeared

This wasn’t a world in which a man had any business with a family; sooner or later Jurgis would find that out also, and give up the fight and shift for himself

Jurgis was so transparently what he pretended to be that his cell mate was as open with him as a child; it was pleasant to tell him adventures, he was so full of wonder and admiration, he was so new to the ways of the country

The crowd had already given Jurgis a name—they called him “the stinker.” This was cruel, but they meant no harm by it, and he took it with a good-natured grin

Our friend had caught now and then a whiff from the sewers over which he lived, but this was the first time that he had ever been splashed by their filth

They were swindlers and thieves of pennies and dimes, and they had been trapped and put out of the way by the swindlers and thieves of millions of dollars

To most of this Jurgis tried not to listen

Now and then in the midst of it his thoughts would take flight; and then the tears would come into his eyes—and he would be called back by the jeering laughter of his companions

He spent a week in this company, and during all that time he had no word from his home

Jurgis rode in the patrol wagon back to Justice Callahan’s court for trial

One of the first things he made out as he entered the room was Teta Elzbieta and little Kotrina, looking pale and frightened, seated far in the rear

A trembling seized him, and his limbs bent as if for a spring

He subsided, but he never took his eyes off his enemy

He and the company lawyer, who was with him, came and took seats within the judge’s railing; and a minute later the clerk called Jurgis’ name, and the policeman jerked him to his feet and led him before the bar, gripping him tightly by the arm, lest he should spring upon the boss

Jurgis listened while the man entered the witness chair, took the oath, and told his story

Half an hour later he had been violently attacked, knocked down, and almost choked to death

“They will probably not be necessary,” observed the judge and he turned to Jurgis

“You admit attacking the plaintiff.” he asked

“Him.” inquired Jurgis, pointing at the boss

“Yes,” said the judge

“I hit him, sir,” said Jurgis

“Say ‘your Honor,’” said the officer, pinching his arm hard

“Your Honor,” said Jurgis, obediently

“You tried to choke him.”

“Yes, sir, your Honor.”

“Ever been arrested before.”

“No, sir, your Honor.”

“What have you to say for yourself.”

Jurgis hesitated

Finally, the prisoner made it understood that his vocabulary was inadequate, and there stepped up a dapper young man with waxed mustaches, bidding him speak in any language he knew

Jurgis began; supposing that he would be given time, he explained how the boss had taken advantage of his wife’s position to make advances to her and had threatened her with the loss of her place

When the interpreter had translated this, the judge, whose calendar was crowded, and whose automobile was ordered for a certain hour, interrupted with the remark: “Oh, I see

Jurgis hesitated, somewhat taken aback; he began to explain that they were very poor—that work was hard to get—

“I see,” said Justice Callahan; “so instead you thought you would knock him down.” He turned to the plaintiff, inquiring, “Is there any truth in this story, Mr Connor.”

“Not a particle, your Honor,” said the boss

“Yes, I know,” said the judge

Thirty days and costs

Jurgis had been listening in perplexity

“What will my family do.” he cried frantically

“You would have done well to think about them before you committed the assault,” said the judge dryly, as he turned to look at the next prisoner

Jurgis would have spoken again, but the policeman had seized him by the collar and was twisting it, and a second policeman was making for him with evidently hostile intentions

They thrust him into a cell room, where other prisoners were waiting; and as soon as court had adjourned they led him down with them into the “Black Maria,” and drove him away

This time Jurgis was bound for the “Bridewell,” a petty jail where Cook County prisoners serve their time

It would have been quite intolerable, staying in a cell with this wild beast, but for the fact that all day long the prisoners were put at work breaking stone

Ten days of his thirty Jurgis spent thus, without hearing a word from his family; then one day a keeper came and informed him that there was a visitor to see him

Jurgis turned white, and so weak at the knees that he could hardly leave his cell

The man led him down the corridor and a flight of steps to the visitors’ room, which was barred like a cell

“Well.” he said, weakly

Little Stanislovas was also trembling, and all but too frightened to speak

“They—they sent me to tell you—” he said, with a gulp

“Well.” Jurgis repeated

“Never mind that,” Jurgis cried, wildly

“Ona is very sick,” Stanislovas said; “and we are almost starving

Jurgis gripped the chair tighter; there were beads of perspiration on his forehead, and his hand shook

“I—can’t help you,” he said

“Ona lies in her room all day,” the boy went on, breathlessly

He said he would turn us out of the house

A sob choked Stanislovas, and he stopped

“What’s the matter with Marija.” cried Jurgis

“She’s cut her hand.” said the boy

She can’t work and it’s all turning green, and the company doctor says she may—she may have to have it cut off

The little fellow stopped again, beginning to whimper

“I—I will,” sobbed Stanislovas

“It’s so—so cold all the time

“God.” Jurgis half shouted, and he took a step toward the child

Now he clenched his hands, looking as if he would try to break through the grating

“I did—I did.” wailed Stanislovas, shrinking from him in terror

And we had nothing to eat, and oh, it was so cold

“Ona.”

“Yes

We were all starving

Jurgis reeled, and gave a gasp

“She tried to,” said Stanislovas, gazing at him in perplexity

The man breathed hard, three or four times

“Go—on,” he panted, finally

“I went with her,” said Stanislovas, “but Miss Henderson wouldn’t take her back

And Connor saw her and cursed her

Jurgis could not speak; he could only stare, his eyes starting out

And my boss would not take me back, either—Ona says he knows Connor, and that’s the reason; they’ve all got a grudge against us now

“Kotrina.”

“Yes, she’s been selling papers, too

Mother hasn’t any work either, because the sausage department is shut down; and she goes and begs at houses with a basket, and people give her food

So little Stanislovas went on, sobbing as he talked; and Jurgis stood, gripping the table tightly, saying not a word, but feeling that his head would burst; it was like having weights piled upon him, one after another, crushing the life out of him

Just when it seemed to him that another turn of the screw would kill him, little Stanislovas stopped

“You cannot help us.” he said weakly

Jurgis shook his head

“They won’t give you anything here.”

He shook it again

“When are you coming out.”

“Three weeks yet,” Jurgis answered

And the boy gazed around him uncertainly

“Then I might as well go,” he said

Jurgis nodded

“Here,” he said, holding out the fourteen cents

And Stanislovas took it, and after a little more hesitation, started for the door

“Good-by, Jurgis,” he said, and the other noticed that he walked unsteadily as he passed out of sight

For a minute or so Jurgis stood clinging to his chair, reeling and swaying; then the keeper touched him on the arm, and he turned and went back to breaking stone

CHAPTER XVIII

Jurgis did not get out of the Bridewell quite as soon as he had expected

So he doffed his prison garb, and put on his old fertilizer clothing, and heard the door of the prison clang behind him

He stood upon the steps, bewildered; he could hardly believe that it was true,—that the sky was above him again and the open street before him; that he was a free man

But then the cold began to strike through his clothes, and he started quickly away

There had been a heavy snow, and now a thaw had set in; fine sleety rain was falling, driven by a wind that pierced Jurgis to the bone

Now as he trudged on the rain soon wet it through; there were six inches of watery slush on the sidewalks, so that his feet would soon have been soaked, even had there been no holes in his shoes

Jurgis had had enough to eat in the jail, and the work had been the least trying of any that he had done since he came to Chicago; but even so, he had not grown strong—the fear and grief that had preyed upon his mind had worn him thin

The Bridewell grounds were on the outskirts of the city and the country around them was unsettled and wild—on one side was the big drainage canal, and on the other a maze of railroad tracks, and so the wind had full sweep

After walking a ways, Jurgis met a little ragamuffin whom he hailed: “Hey, sonny.” The boy cocked one eye at him—he knew that Jurgis was a “jailbird” by his shaven head

“Wot yer want.” he queried

“How do you go to the stockyards.” Jurgis demanded

“I don’t go,” replied the boy

Jurgis hesitated a moment, nonplussed

“Why don’t yer say so then.” was the response, and the boy pointed to the northwest, across the tracks

“How far is it.” Jurgis asked

“I dunno,” said the other

“Twenty miles.” Jurgis echoed, and his face fell

He had to walk every foot of it, for they had turned him out of jail without a penny in his pockets

Yet, when he once got started, and his blood had warmed with walking, he forgot everything in the fever of his thoughts

His hands were his own, and he could help them, he could do battle for them against the world

For an hour or so he walked thus, and then he began to look about him

Soon he met a farmer driving a two-horse wagon loaded with straw, and he stopped him

“Is this the way to the stockyards.” he asked

The farmer scratched his head

“I dunno jest where they be,” he said

Jurgis looked dazed

“I was told this was the way,” he said

“Who told you.”

“A boy.”

“Well, mebbe he was playing a joke on ye

I’d take ye in, only I’ve come a long ways an’ I’m loaded heavy

So Jurgis turned and followed, and toward the end of the morning he began to see Chicago again

Occasionally the cars would stop for some minutes, and wagons and streetcars would crowd together waiting, the drivers swearing at each other, or hiding beneath umbrellas out of the rain; at such times Jurgis would dodge under the gates and run across the tracks and between the cars, taking his life into his hands

He crossed a long bridge over a river frozen solid and covered with slush

The solitary trampish-looking foreigner, with water-soaked clothing and haggard face and anxious eyes, was as much alone as he hurried past them, as much unheeded and as lost, as if he had been a thousand miles deep in a wilderness

A policeman gave him his direction and told him that he had five miles to go

It was late afternoon then, and he was hungry, but the dinner invitations hung out of the saloons were not for him

So he came at last to the stockyards, to the black volcanoes of smoke and the lowing cattle and the stench

In ten minutes more he had reached his street, and home

He was half running as he came round the corner

What was the matter with the house

Jurgis looked twice, bewildered; then he glanced at the house next door and at the one beyond—then at the saloon on the corner

But the house—the house was a different color

He came a couple of steps nearer

How strange it made it seem

Jurgis went closer yet, but keeping on the other side of the street

New, white curtains, stiff and shiny

Then suddenly the front door opened

A boy had come out, a stranger to him; a big, fat, rosy-cheeked youngster, such as had never been seen in his home before

Jurgis stared at the boy, fascinated

When Jurgis started slowly across the street toward him, he gave a quick glance about, meditating retreat, but then he concluded to stand his ground

Jurgis took hold of the railing of the steps, for he was a little unsteady

“What—what are you doing here.” he managed to gasp

“Go on.” said the boy

“You—” Jurgis tried again

“Me.” answered the boy, angrily

“You live here.” Jurgis panted

“You live here

The boy looked surprised

“Your family.” he echoed

And Jurgis started toward him

“I—this is my house.” he cried

“Come off.” said the boy; then suddenly the door upstairs opened, and he called: “Hey, ma

A stout Irishwoman came to the top of the steps

“What’s that.” she demanded

Jurgis turned toward her

This is my home

The woman stared at him in frightened wonder, she must have thought she was dealing with a maniac—Jurgis looked like one

“Your home.” she echoed

“My home.” he half shrieked

“You must be mistaken,” she answered him

They told us so

“What have they done with my family.” shouted Jurgis, frantically

A light had begun to break upon the woman; perhaps she had had doubts of what “they” had told her

“I bought the house only three days ago, and there was nobody here, and they told me it was all new

“Rented it.” panted Jurgis

I own it

She made him understand at last that she knew nothing

He turned and started at a run

Grandmother Majauszkiene came to the door herself

Wouldn’t Jurgis come in and rest

And so Jurgis turned and staggered away

He did not go very far round the corner he gave out completely, and sat down on the steps of a saloon, and hid his face in his hands, and shook all over with dry, racking sobs

Their home

Only think what he had suffered for that house—what miseries they had all suffered for it—the price they had paid for it

The whole long agony came back to him

And their house was gone—they were back where they had started from, flung out into the cold to starve and freeze

Jurgis could see all the truth now—could see himself, through the whole long course of events, the victim of ravenous vultures that had torn into his vitals and devoured him; of fiends that had racked and tortured him, mocking him, meantime, jeering in his face

If Jurgis so much as raised a hand against them, back he would go into that wild-beast pen from which he had just escaped

To get up and go away was to give up, to acknowledge defeat, to leave the strange family in possession; and Jurgis might have sat shivering in the rain for hours before he could do that, had it not been for the thought of his family

It might be that he had worse things yet to learn—and so he got to his feet and started away, walking on, wearily, half-dazed

To Aniele’s house, in back of the yards, was a good two miles; the distance had never seemed longer to Jurgis, and when he saw the familiar dingy-gray shanty his heart was beating fast

He ran up the steps and began to hammer upon the door

The old woman herself came to open it

“Is Ona here.” he cried, breathlessly

“Yes,” was the answer, “she’s here.”

“How—” Jurgis began, and then stopped short, clutching convulsively at the side of the door

For a moment Jurgis stood half-paralyzed with fright; then he bounded past the old woman and into the room

It was Aniele’s kitchen, and huddled round the stove were half a dozen women, pale and frightened

But they sat dumb, gazing back at him, panic-stricken; and a second later came another piercing scream

It was from the rear of the house, and upstairs

She seized him by the sleeve with her good hand, panting wildly, “No, no, Jurgis

“What do you mean.” he gasped

“You mustn’t go up,” she cried

Jurgis was half-crazed with bewilderment and fright

“What’s the matter.” he shouted

Marija clung to him tightly; he could hear Ona sobbing and moaning above, and he fought to get away and climb up, without waiting for her reply

You mustn’t go up

“The child.” he echoed in perplexity

Marija answered him, in a whisper: “The new one.”

And then Jurgis went limp, and caught himself on the ladder

“But it isn’t time,” he added, wildly

Marija nodded

And then again came Ona’s scream, smiting him like a blow in the face, making him wince and turn white

Her voice died away into a wail—then he heard her sobbing again, “My God—let me die, let me die.” And Marija hung her arms about him, crying: “Come out

She dragged him back into the kitchen, half carrying him, for he had gone all to pieces

In the room he sank into a chair, trembling like a leaf, Marija still holding him, and the women staring at him in dumb, helpless fright

And then again Ona cried out; he could hear it nearly as plainly here, and he staggered to his feet

“How long has this been going on.” he panted

“Not very long,” Marija answered, and then, at a signal from Aniele, she rushed on: “You go away, Jurgis you can’t help—go away and come back later

“Who’s with her.” Jurgis demanded; and then, seeing Marija hesitating, he cried again, “Who’s with her.”

“She’s—she’s all right,” she answered

“But the doctor.” he panted

He seized Marija by the arm; she trembled, and her voice sank beneath a whisper as she replied, “We—we have no money.” Then, frightened at the look on his face, she exclaimed: “It’s all right, Jurgis

You don’t understand—go away—go away

Above her protests Jurgis heard Ona again; he was almost out of his mind

At the end of a quarter of an hour he rushed up the steps again, and for fear that he would break in the door they had to open it and let him in

There was no arguing with him

Had they tried to get a doctor

“We couldn’t promise, Jurgis,” protested Marija

“But I can work,” Jurgis exclaimed

“Yes,” she answered—“but we thought you were in jail

How could we know when you would return

Marija went on to tell how she had tried to find a midwife, and how they had demanded ten, fifteen, even twenty-five dollars, and that in cash

And we owe Aniele for two weeks’ rent, and she is nearly starving, and is afraid of being turned out

“And the children.” cried Jurgis

“The children have not been home for three days, the weather has been so bad

Jurgis was standing by the table, and he caught himself with his hand; his head sank and his arms shook—it looked as if he were going to collapse

She drew out a dirty rag, in one corner of which she had something tied

“Here, Jurgis.” she said, “I have some money

She unwrapped it and counted it out—thirty-four cents

And maybe the rest can help—give him some money, you; he will pay you back some day, and it will do him good to have something to think about, even if he doesn’t succeed

And so the other women turned out the contents of their pocketbooks; most of them had only pennies and nickels, but they gave him all

Then Jurgis thrust it into his pocket, still holding it tightly in his fist, and started away at a run

CHAPTER XIX

“Madame Haupt Hebamme”, ran a sign, swinging from a second-story window over a saloon on the avenue; at a side door was another sign, with a hand pointing up a dingy flight of stairs

Jurgis went up them, three at a time

Madame Haupt was frying pork and onions, and had her door half open to let out the smoke

She wore a filthy blue wrapper, and her teeth were black

“Vot is it.” she said, when she saw Jurgis

He had run like mad all the way and was so out of breath he could hardly speak

“Come quickly.” Madame Haupt set the frying pan to one side and wiped her hands on her wrapper

“You vant me to come for a case.” she inquired

“Yes,” gasped Jurgis

“I haf yust come back from a case,” she said

“I haf had no time to eat my dinner

“Yes—it is.” cried he

“Vell, den, perhaps—vot you pay.”

“I—I—how much do you want.” Jurgis stammered

“Tventy-five dollars.” His face fell

“I can’t pay that,” he said

The woman was watching him narrowly

“How much do you pay.” she demanded

“Must I pay now—right away.”

“Yes; all my customers do.”

“I—I haven’t much money,” Jurgis began in an agony of dread

“I’ve been in—in trouble—and my money is gone

“Vot is your work.”

“I have no place now

I must get one

“How much haf you got now.”

He could hardly bring himself to reply

When he said “A dollar and a quarter,” the woman laughed in his face

“I vould not put on my hat for a dollar and a quarter,” she said

“It’s all I’ve got,” he pleaded, his voice breaking

“I must get some one—my wife will die

Madame Haupt had put back her pork and onions on the stove

“I can’t do it—I haven’t got it.” Jurgis protested

The woman turned to her work

“Dot is all to try to sheat me

“I’ve just been in jail,” Jurgis cried—he was ready to get down upon his knees to the woman—“and I had no money before, and my family has almost starved.”

“Vere is your friends, dot ought to help you.”

“They are all poor,” he answered

“They gave me this

“Haven’t you got notting you can sell.”

“I have nothing, I tell you—I have nothing,” he cried, frantically

“Can’t you borrow it, den

If you loose dem now how you tink you feel den

Madame Haupt was pointing her cooking-fork at Jurgis persuasively; but her words were more than he could bear

He flung up his hands with a gesture of despair and turned and started away

“I vill make it five dollars for you.”

She followed behind him, arguing with him

Vy, I haf never took a case in my life so sheap as dot

Jurgis interrupted her with an oath of rage

I haven’t got it

He turned and started away again

I vill go mit you

He went back into the room again

“It is not goot to tink of anybody suffering,” she said, in a melancholy voice

“I might as vell go mit you for noffing as vot you offer me, but I vill try to help you

“Three or four blocks from here.”

“Tree or four

Gott in Himmel, it ought to be vorth more

“As soon as I can.”

“Some time dis mont’.”

“Yes, within a month,” said poor Jurgis

“Anything

“Vere is de dollar und a quarter.” persisted Madame Haupt, relentlessly

Jurgis put the money on the table and the woman counted it and stowed it away

But Madame Haupt could only go so far at a step, and it took all her attention to get the needed breath for that

They came at last to the house, and to the group of frightened women in the kitchen

The more cases this goose grease is used in, the better luck it brings to the midwife, and so she keeps it upon her kitchen mantelpiece or stowed away in a cupboard with her dirty clothes, for months, and sometimes even for years

Then they escorted her to the ladder, and Jurgis heard her give an exclamation of dismay

You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.” Jurgis stood in the doorway and listened to her scolding, half drowning out the horrible moans and screams of Ona

At last Aniele succeeded in pacifying her, and she essayed the ascent; then, however, she had to be stopped while the old woman cautioned her about the floor of the garret

Then suddenly Aniele came to him and took him by the arm

“Now,” she said, “you go away

Do as I tell you—you have done all you can, and you are only in the way

“But where shall I go.” Jurgis asked, helplessly

“I don’t know where,” she answered

“Go on the street, if there is no other place—only go

In the end she and Marija pushed him out of the door and shut it behind him

He set out for the place as fast as he could walk

“Hello, Jack,” said the saloon-keeper, when he entered—they call all foreigners and unskilled men “Jack” in Packingtown

Jurgis went straight to the bar

I walked home all the way, and I’ve not a cent, and had nothing to eat since this morning

The saloon-keeper gazed at him, with his haggard white face and his blue trembling lips

“Fill her up.” he said

Jurgis could hardly hold the bottle, his hands shook so

“Don’t be afraid,” said the saloon-keeper, “fill her up.”

So Jurgis drank a large glass of whisky, and then turned to the lunch counter, in obedience to the other’s suggestion

He ate all he dared, stuffing it in as fast as he could; and then, after trying to speak his gratitude, he went and sat down by the big red stove in the middle of the room

It was too good to last, however—like all things in this hard world

Also it was Saturday night, and in a couple of hours would come a violin and a cornet, and in the rear part of the saloon the families of the neighborhood would dance and feast upon wienerwurst and lager, until two or three o’clock in the morning

He was used to the sight of human wrecks, this saloon-keeper; he “fired” dozens of them every night, just as haggard and cold and forlorn as this one

“You’ve been up against it, I see,” he said

In the rear of the saloon were the cellar stairs

There was a door above and another below, both safely padlocked, making the stairs an admirable place to stow away a customer who might still chance to have money, or a political light whom it was not advisable to kick out of doors

So Jurgis spent the night

When at last these ceased, he expected that he would be turned out into the street; as this did not happen, he fell to wondering whether the man had forgotten him

In the end, when the silence and suspense were no longer to be borne, he got up and hammered on the door; and the proprietor came, yawning and rubbing his eyes

He was keeping open all night, and dozing between customers

“I want to go home,” Jurgis said

“Why the hell didn’t you say so before.” said the man

He turned toward Aniele’s and started at a run

There was a light burning in the kitchen window and the blinds were drawn

The door was unlocked and Jurgis rushed in

Aniele, Marija, and the rest of the women were huddled about the stove, exactly as before; with them were several newcomers, Jurgis noticed—also he noticed that the house was silent

“Well.” he said

No one answered him, they sat staring at him with their pale faces

And then, by the light of the smoky lamp, he saw Marija who sat nearest him, shaking her head slowly

“Not yet,” she said

And Jurgis gave a cry of dismay

Again Marija’s head shook

“I don’t hear her,” he gasped

“She’s been quiet a long time,” replied the other

There was another pause—broken suddenly by a voice from the attic: “Hello, there.”

Several of the women ran into the next room, while Marija sprang toward Jurgis

Her hands and arms were smeared with blood, and blood was splashed upon her clothing and her face

She stood breathing hard, and gazing about her; no one made a sound

“I haf done my best,” she began suddenly

Again there was silence

“It ain’t my fault,” she said

Marija was clutching Jurgis with all the power of her one well arm

Then suddenly Madame Haupt turned to Aniele

“You haf not got something to drink, hey.” she queried

Aniele shook her head

“Herr Gott.” exclaimed Madame Haupt

It is not my fault if der baby comes mit one arm first, so dot I can’t save it

Here Madame Haupt paused for a moment to get her breath; and Marija, seeing the beads of sweat on Jurgis’s forehead, and feeling the quivering of his frame, broke out in a low voice: “How is Ona.”

“How is she.” echoed Madame Haupt

She is young, und she might haf got over it, und been vell und strong, if she had been treated right

And Jurgis gave a frantic scream

“She vill die, of course,” said the other angrily

The garret was lighted by a candle stuck upon a board; it had almost burned itself out, and was sputtering and smoking as Jurgis rushed up the ladder

Upon the pallet lay Ona

She was covered with a blanket, but he could see her shoulders and one arm lying bare; she was so shrunken he would scarcely have known her—she was all but a skeleton, and as white as a piece of chalk

He staggered toward her and fell upon his knees with a cry of anguish: “Ona

She did not stir

Answer me

There was the faintest quivering of the eyelids, and he called again in frenzy: “Ona

Then suddenly her eyes opened one instant

He clutched her hands, he shook her, he caught her in his arms and pressed her to him but she lay cold and still—she was gone—she was gone

The word rang through him like the sound of a bell, echoing in the far depths of him, making forgotten chords to vibrate, old shadowy fears to stir—fears of the dark, fears of the void, fears of annihilation

He was gone away himself, stumbling through the shadows, and groping after the soul that had fled

So he lay

Her life had hardly begun—and here she lay murdered—mangled, tortured to death

It was morning when he rose up and came down into the kitchen—haggard and ashen gray, reeling and dazed

More of the neighbors had come in, and they stared at him in silence as he sank down upon a chair by the table and buried his face in his arms

A few minutes later the front door opened; a blast of cold and snow rushed in, and behind it little Kotrina, breathless from running, and blue with the cold

“I’m home again.” she exclaimed

And then, seeing Jurgis, she stopped with an exclamation

Before anyone could reply, Jurgis started up; he went toward her, walking unsteadily

“Where have you been.” he demanded

“Selling papers with the boys,” she said

“Have you any money.” he demanded

“Yes.”

“How much.”

“Nearly three dollars, Jurgis.”

“Give it to me.”

Kotrina, frightened by his manner, glanced at the others

Jurgis took it without a word, and went out of the door and down the street

Three doors away was a saloon

“How much is the bottle.” he said

CHAPTER XX

But a big man cannot stay drunk very long on three dollars

That was Sunday morning, and Monday night Jurgis came home, sober and sick, realizing that he had spent every cent the family owned, and had not bought a single instant’s forgetfulness with it

Ona was not yet buried; but the police had been notified, and on the morrow they would put the body in a pine coffin and take it to the potter’s field

She had crowded all her boarders into one room on Ona’s account, but now he could go up in the garret where he belonged—and not there much longer, either, if he did not pay her some rent

Jurgis went without a word, and, stepping over half a dozen sleeping boarders in the next room, ascended the ladder

Marija said not a word to Jurgis; he crept in like a whipped cur, and went and sat down by the body

Perhaps he ought to have meditated upon the hunger of the children, and upon his own baseness; but he thought only of Ona, he gave himself up again to the luxury of grief

He could have screamed aloud with the horror and despair of it; a sweat of agony beaded his forehead, yet he dared not make a sound—he scarcely dared to breathe, because of his shame and loathing of himself

Late at night came Elzbieta, having gotten the money for a mass, and paid for it in advance, lest she should be tempted too sorely at home

Then she came over to Jurgis and sat down beside him

She said not a word of reproach—she and Marija had chosen that course before; she would only plead with him, here by the corpse of his dead wife

She did this because it was her nature—she asked no questions about the justice of it, nor the worth-whileness of life in which destruction and death ran riot

And this old common-sense view she labored to impress upon Jurgis, pleading with him with tears in her eyes

It was a struggle for life with her; she was not afraid that Jurgis would go on drinking, for he had no money for that, but she was wild with dread at the thought that he might desert them, might take to the road, as Jonas had done

But with Ona’s dead body beneath his eyes, Jurgis could not well think of treason to his child

They might trust him, he would keep his word, come what might

And so he was out before daylight the next morning, headache, heartache, and all

But the boss shook his head when he saw him—no, his place had been filled long ago, and there was no room for him

“Do you think there will be.” Jurgis asked

“No,” said the other, “it will not be worth your while to wait—there will be nothing for you here.”

Jurgis stood gazing at him in perplexity

“What is the matter.” he asked

The other met his look with one of cold indifference, and answered, “There will be nothing for you here, I said.”

Jurgis had his suspicions as to the dreadful meaning of that incident, and he went away with a sinking at the heart

There was no work for him that day

Jurgis had made a good many acquaintances in his long services at the yards—there were saloonkeepers who would trust him for a drink and a sandwich, and members of his old union who would lend him a dime at a pinch

Meantime, Teta Elzbieta would go and beg, over in the Hyde Park district, and the children would bring home enough to pacify Aniele, and keep them all alive

It was at the end of a week of this sort of waiting, roaming about in the bitter winds or loafing in saloons, that Jurgis stumbled on a chance in one of the cellars of Jones’s big packing plant

He saw a foreman passing the open doorway, and hailed him for a job

“Push a truck.” inquired the man, and Jurgis answered, “Yes, sir.” before the words were well out of his mouth

“What’s your name.” demanded the other

“Jurgis Rudkus.”

“Worked in the yards before.”

“Yes.”

“Whereabouts.”

“Two places—Brown’s killing beds and Durham’s fertilizer mill.”

“Why did you leave there.”

“The first time I had an accident, and the last time I was sent up for a month.”

“I see

Well, I’ll give you a trial

So Jurgis rushed home with the wild tidings that he had a job—that the terrible siege was over

The foreman came in shortly afterward, and when he saw Jurgis he frowned

“Oh,” he said, “I promised you a job, didn’t I.”

“Yes, sir,” said Jurgis

“Well, I’m sorry, but I made a mistake

Jurgis stared, dumfounded

“What’s the matter.” he gasped

“Nothing,” said the man, “only I can’t use you.”

There was the same cold, hostile stare that he had had from the boss of the fertilizer mill

He knew that there was no use in saying a word, and he turned and went away

Out in the saloons the men could tell him all about the meaning of it; they gazed at him with pitying eyes—poor devil, he was blacklisted

It was worth a fortune to the packers to keep their blacklist effective, as a warning to the men and a means of keeping down union agitation and political discontent

Jurgis went home, carrying these new tidings to the family council

There was nothing in Packingtown but packing houses; and so it was the same thing as evicting him from his home

He and the two women spent all day and half the night discussing it

Then all day he was to pace the streets with hundreds and thousands of other homeless wretches inquiring at stores, warehouses, and factories for a chance; and at night he was to crawl into some doorway or underneath a truck, and hide there until midnight, when he might get into one of the station houses, and spread a newspaper upon the floor, and lie down in the midst of a throng of “bums” and beggars, reeking with alcohol and tobacco, and filthy with vermin and disease

So for two weeks more Jurgis fought with the demon of despair

If Jurgis lost only his time, it was because he had nothing else to lose; whenever a smooth-tongued agent would tell him of the wonderful positions he had on hand, he could only shake his head sorrowfully and say that he had not the necessary dollar to deposit; when it was explained to him what “big money” he and all his family could make by coloring photographs, he could only promise to come in again when he had two dollars to invest in the outfit

In the end Jurgis got a chance through an accidental meeting with an old-time acquaintance of his union days

His knees nearly gave way beneath him when the foreman, after looking him over and questioning him, told him that he could find an opening for him

How much this accident meant to Jurgis he realized only by stages; for he found that the harvester works were the sort of place to which philanthropists and reformers pointed with pride

Day after day Jurgis discovered these things—things never expected nor dreamed of by him—until this new place came to seem a kind of a heaven to him

It was an enormous establishment, covering a hundred and sixty acres of ground, employing five thousand people, and turning out over three hundred thousand machines every year—a good part of all the harvesting and mowing machines used in the country

In other places all these various parts were dipped into troughs of paint and hung up to dry, and then slid along on trolleys to a room where men streaked them with red and yellow, so that they might look cheerful in the harvest fields

Jurgis’s friend worked upstairs in the casting rooms, and his task was to make the molds of a certain part

If we are the greatest nation the sun ever shone upon, it would seem to be mainly because we have been able to goad our wage-earners to this pitch of frenzy; though there are a few other things that are great among us including our drink-bill, which is a billion and a quarter of dollars a year, and doubling itself every decade

There was a machine which stamped out the iron plates, and then another which, with a mighty thud, mashed them to the shape of the sitting-down portion of the American farmer

Then they were piled upon a truck, and it was Jurgis’s task to wheel them to the room where the machines were “assembled.” This was child’s play for him, and he got a dollar and seventy-five cents a day for it; on Saturday he paid Aniele the seventy-five cents a week he owed her for the use of her garret, and also redeemed his overcoat, which Elzbieta had put in pawn when he was in jail

This last was a great blessing

Of course the doors could never be closed, and so the cars were as cold as outdoors; Jurgis, like many others, found it better to spend his fare for a drink and a free lunch, to give him strength to walk

These, however, were all slight matters to a man who had escaped from Durham’s fertilizer mill

He laughed to himself as he thought how he would hang on to this job

And then one afternoon, the ninth of his work in the place, when he went to get his overcoat he saw a group of men crowded before a placard on the door, and when he went over and asked what it was, they told him that beginning with the morrow his department of the harvester works would be closed until further notice

CHAPTER XXI

That was the way they did it

So many tens of thousands already in the city, homeless and begging for work, and now several thousand more added to them

Jurgis walked home-with his pittance of pay in his pocket, heartbroken, overwhelmed

What a hellish mockery it was, anyway, that a man should slave to make harvesting machines for the country, only to be turned out to starve for doing his duty too well

It took him two days to get over this heart-sickening disappointment

So he went out once more

For another ten days he roamed the streets and alleys of the huge city, sick and hungry, begging for any work

Then Jurgis fought like a wild beast to get into the big Harrison Street police station, and slept down in a corridor, crowded with two other men upon a single step

He had to fight often in these days to fight for a place near the factory gates, and now and again with gangs on the street

They always had the policeman “squared,” and so there was no use in expecting protection

That Jurgis did not starve to death was due solely to the pittance the children brought him

Also one night a strange man caught little Kotrina by the arm and tried to persuade her into a dark cellar-way, an experience which filled her with such terror that she was hardly to be kept at work

At last, on a Sunday, as there was no use looking for work, Jurgis went home by stealing rides on the cars

He found that they had been waiting for him for three days—there was a chance of a job for him

It was quite a story

She had on a hat with a bird upon it, Juozapas added, and a long fur snake around her neck

She really came, the very next morning, and climbed the ladder to the garret, and stood and stared about her, turning pale at the sight of the blood stains on the floor where Ona had died

So spoke Elzbieta, naïvely, and the young lady laughed and was rather at a loss for an answer—she stood and gazed about her, and thought of a cynical remark that had been made to her, that she was standing upon the brink of the pit of hell and throwing in snowballs to lower the temperature

Elzbieta was glad to have somebody to listen, and she told all their woes—what had happened to Ona, and the jail, and the loss of their home, and Marija’s accident, and how Ona had died, and how Jurgis could get no work

The end of it was that the young lady sent them a basket of things to eat, and left a letter that Jurgis was to take to a gentleman who was superintendent in one of the mills of the great steelworks in South Chicago

The steel-works were fifteen miles away, and as usual it was so contrived that one had to pay two fares to get there

A river of them poured in through the gate—and then gradually ebbed away again, until there were only a few late ones running, and the watchman pacing up and down, and the hungry strangers stamping and shivering

Jurgis presented his precious letter

On one side of the grounds ran a railroad with a dozen tracks, and on the other side lay the lake, where steamers came to load

Jurgis had time enough to stare and speculate, for it was two hours before he was summoned

Well, then, they would go and see

So they began a tour, among sights that made Jurgis stare amazed

Jurgis clung to his guide like a scared child to its nurse, and while the latter hailed one foreman after another to ask if they could use another unskilled man, he stared about him and marveled

He was taken to the Bessemer furnace, where they made billets of steel—a dome-like building, the size of a big theater

Then the great caldron tilted back again, empty, and Jurgis saw to his relief that no one was hurt, and turned and followed his guide out into the sunlight

They went through the blast furnaces, through rolling mills where bars of steel were tossed about and chopped like bits of cheese

All around and above giant machine arms were flying, giant wheels were turning, great hammers crashing; traveling cranes creaked and groaned overhead, reaching down iron hands and seizing iron prey—it was like standing in the center of the earth, where the machinery of time was revolving

By and by they came to the place where steel rails were made; and Jurgis heard a toot behind him, and jumped out of the way of a car with a white-hot ingot upon it, the size of a man’s body

There was no rest for it until it was cold and black—and then it needed only to be cut and straightened to be ready for a railroad

It was at the end of this rail’s progress that Jurgis got his chance

So he took off his coat and set to work on the spot

It took him two hours to get to this place every day and cost him a dollar and twenty cents a week

There was no chance for a woman at the steelworks, and Marija was now ready for work again, and lured on from day to day by the hope of finding it at the yards

In a week Jurgis got over his sense of helplessness and bewilderment in the rail mill

The company doctor bandaged it up, but he got no other thanks from any one, and was laid up for eight working days without any pay

Most fortunately, at this juncture, Elzbieta got the long-awaited chance to go at five o’clock in the morning and help scrub the office floors of one of the packers

Juozapas was away raking in the dump a good part of the time, and Elzbieta and Marija were hunting for more work

Antanas was now over a year and a half old, and was a perfect talking machine

The more of a fighter he was the better—he would need to fight before he got through

Jurgis had got the habit of buying the Sunday paper whenever he had the money; a most wonderful paper could be had for only five cents, a whole armful, with all the news of the world set forth in big headlines, that Jurgis could spell out slowly, with the children to help him at the long words

The first time that the little rascal burst out with “God damn,” his father nearly rolled off the chair with glee; but in the end he was sorry for this, for Antanas was soon “God-damning” everything and everybody

And then, when he was able to use his hands, Jurgis took his bedding again and went back to his task of shifting rails

So once more Jurgis began to make plans and dream dreams

And then one Saturday night he jumped off the car and started home, with the sun shining low under the edge of a bank of clouds that had been pouring floods of water into the mud-soaked street

“What’s the matter.” he cried

A dead silence had fallen in the room, and he saw that every one was staring at him

“What’s the matter.” he exclaimed again

And then, up in the garret, he heard sounds of wailing, in Marija’s voice

“No, no.” she exclaimed

“What is it.” he shouted

And the old woman answered him weakly: “It’s Antanas

He’s dead

CHAPTER XXII

Jurgis took the news in a peculiar way

Then he pushed Aniele aside and strode into the next room and climbed the ladder

In the corner was a blanket, with a form half showing beneath it; and beside it lay Elzbieta, whether crying or in a faint, Jurgis could not tell

He clenched his hands tighter yet, and his voice was hard as he spoke

“How did it happen.” he asked

Marija scarcely heard him in her agony

The sidewalk in front of the house was a platform made of half-rotten boards, about five feet above the level of the sunken street

“How did he come to be there.” he demanded

“He went—he went out to play,” Marija sobbed, her voice choking her

“We couldn’t make him stay in

“Are you sure that he is dead.” he demanded

“Ai

ai.” she wailed

Then Jurgis stood a few seconds, wavering

He went straight to the door, passed out, and started down the street

When his wife had died, Jurgis made for the nearest saloon, but he did not do that now, though he had his week’s wages in his pocket

Now and then he would whisper to himself: “Dead

Finally, he got up and walked on again

He started down the track, and when he was past the gate-keeper’s shanty he sprang forward and swung himself on to one of the cars

By and by the train stopped again, and Jurgis sprang down and ran under the car, and hid himself upon the truck

And every time that a thought of it assailed him—a tender memory, a trace of a tear—he rose up, cursing with rage, and pounded it down

He was fighting for his life; he gnashed his teeth together in his desperation

And meantime his father had thought the last thought about him that he meant to; he was going to think of himself, he was going to fight for himself, against the world that had baffled him and tortured him

So he went on, tearing up all the flowers from the garden of his soul, and setting his heel upon them

The train thundered deafeningly, and a storm of dust blew in his face; but though it stopped now and then through the night, he clung where he was—he would cling there until he was driven off, for every mile that he got from Packingtown meant another load from his mind

Whenever the cars stopped a warm breeze blew upon him, a breeze laden with the perfume of fresh fields, of honeysuckle and clover

Upon the top of the car was a brakeman, who shook his fist and swore; Jurgis waved his hand derisively, and started across the country

Only think that he had been a countryman all his life; and for three long years he had never seen a country sight nor heard a country sound

And now he felt like a bird lifted up and borne away upon a gale; he stopped and stared at each new sight of wonder—at a herd of cows, and a meadow full of daisies, at hedgerows set thick with June roses, at little birds singing in the trees

Then he came to a farm-house, and after getting himself a stick for protection, he approached it

“I would like to get some breakfast, please,” he said

“Do you want to work.” said the farmer

“No,” said Jurgis

“Then you can’t get anything here,” snapped the other

“I meant to pay for it,” said Jurgis

“Oh,” said the farmer; and then added sarcastically, “We don’t serve breakfast after 7 A.M.”

“I am very hungry,” said Jurgis gravely; “I would like to buy some food.”

“Ask the woman,” said the farmer, nodding over his shoulder

Then he lay for hours, just gazing and drinking in joy; until at last he felt sleepy, and lay down in the shade of a bush

When he awoke the sun was shining hot in his face

It would be the first time that he had been all the way into the water since he left Lithuania

When Jurgis had first come to the stockyards he had been as clean as any workingman could well be

He had had a shower bath in jail, but nothing since—and now he would have a swim

The water was warm, and he splashed about like a very boy in his glee

Then, seeing that the sun was still hot, he took his clothes from the bank and proceeded to wash them, piece by piece; as the dirt and grease went floating off downstream he grunted with satisfaction and soused the clothes again, venturing even to dream that he might get rid of the fertilizer

He hung them all up, and while they were drying he lay down in the sun and had another long sleep

He had no knife, but with some labor he broke himself a good stout club, and, armed with this, he marched down the road again

Before long he came to a big farmhouse, and turned up the lane that led to it

I can pay.” To which the farmer responded promptly, “We don’t feed tramps here

Jurgis went without a word; but as he passed round the barn he came to a freshly ploughed and harrowed field, in which the farmer had set out some young peach trees; and as he walked he jerked up a row of them by the roots, more than a hundred trees in all, before he reached the end of the field

That was his answer, and it showed his mood; from now on he was fighting, and the man who hit him would get all that he gave, every time

Beyond the orchard Jurgis struck through a patch of woods, and then a field of winter grain, and came at last to another road

Before long he saw another farmhouse, and, as it was beginning to cloud over a little, he asked here for shelter as well as food

“Well, I dunno,” said the other

“Sometimes,” said Jurgis, “but I’ll do it out of doors.” When the man had assented, he inquired, “How much will it cost me

“I reckon about twenty cents for supper,” replied the farmer

So Jurgis went in, and sat down at the table with the farmer’s wife and half a dozen children

Jurgis had not had such a feast since his wedding day, and he made a mighty effort to put in his twenty cents’ worth

They were all of them too hungry to talk; but afterward they sat upon the steps and smoked, and the farmer questioned his guest

“I’m not looking for work just now,” Jurgis answered

“I’ll pay ye good,” said the other, eying his big form—“a dollar a day and board ye

“Is that winter as well as summer.” Jurgis demanded quickly

“N—no,” said the farmer; “I couldn’t keep ye after November—I ain’t got a big enough place for that.”

“I see,” said the other, “that’s what I thought

“It ain’t quite the same,” the farmer answered, seeing the point

“Yes,” said Jurgis, “that’s what they all think; and so they crowd into the cities, and when they have to beg or steal to live, then people ask ’em why they don’t go into the country, where help is scarce.” The farmer meditated awhile

“How about when your money’s gone.” he inquired, finally

“Wait till she’s gone,” said Jurgis; “then I’ll see.”

He had a long sleep in the barn and then a big breakfast of coffee and bread and oatmeal and stewed cherries, for which the man charged him only fifteen cents, perhaps having been influenced by his arguments

Then Jurgis bade farewell, and went on his way

Such was the beginning of his life as a tramp

Jurgis was not the mighty man he had once been, but his arms were still good, and there were few farm dogs he needed to hit more than once

Before long there came raspberries, and then blackberries, to help him save his money; and there were apples in the orchards and potatoes in the ground—he learned to note the places and fill his pockets after dark

Half an hour’s chopping wood in his lively fashion was enough to bring him a meal, and when the farmer had seen him working he would sometimes try to bribe him to stay

But Jurgis was not staying

To a man whose whole life had consisted of doing one certain thing all day, until he was so exhausted that he could only lie down and sleep until the next day—and to be now his own master, working as he pleased and when he pleased, and facing a new adventure every hour

Then, too, his health came back to him, all his lost youthful vigor, his joy and power that he had mourned and forgotten

But in the morning he would get up and shake himself, and stride away again to battle with the world

He never asked where he was nor where he was going; the country was big enough, he knew, and there was no danger of his coming to the end of it

And then among them some one would “take a shine” to him, and they would go off together and travel for a week, exchanging reminiscences

Of these professional tramps a great many had, of course, been shiftless and vicious all their lives

If there were more of them on hand than chanced to be needed, the weaker ones died off of cold and hunger, again according to the stern system of nature

It was in the latter part of July, when Jurgis was in Missouri, that he came upon the harvest work

Not that they did not pay them well—any man could get two dollars a day and his board, and the best men could get two dollars and a half or three

The harvest-fever was in the very air, and no man with any spirit in him could be in that region and not catch it

They were in the towns in harvest time, near the lumber camps in the winter, in the cities when the men came there; if a regiment were encamped, or a railroad or canal being made, or a great exposition getting ready, the crowd of women were on hand, living in shanties or saloons or tenement rooms, sometimes eight or ten of them together

In the morning Jurgis had not a cent, and he went out upon the road again

It would be a long time before he could be like the majority of these men of the road, who roamed until the hunger for drink and for women mastered them, and then went to work with a purpose in mind, and stopped when they had the price of a spree

On the contrary, try as he would, Jurgis could not help being made miserable by his conscience

It would come upon him in the most unexpected places—sometimes it fairly drove him to drink

One night he was caught by a thunderstorm, and he sought shelter in a little house just outside of a town

The doctor had said she must bathe him every night, and she, foolish woman, believed him

Jurgis scarcely heard the explanation; he was watching the baby

Between the shame of this and his woe Jurgis could not stand it, and got up and rushed out into the rain

He went on and on down the road, finally coming to a black woods, where he hid and wept as if his heart would break

What terror to see what he had been and now could never be—to see Ona and his child and his own dead self stretching out their arms to him, calling to him across a bottomless abyss—and to know that they were gone from him forever, and he writhing and suffocating in the mire of his own vileness

CHAPTER XXIII

Early in the fall Jurgis set out for Chicago again

He brought fifteen dollars with him, hidden away in one of his shoes, a sum which had been saved from the saloon-keepers, not so much by his conscience, as by the fear which filled him at the thought of being out of work in the city in the winter time

He traveled upon the railroad with several other men, hiding in freight cars at night, and liable to be thrown off at any time, regardless of the speed of the train

There was no place in the city where he could wash even his face, unless he went down to the lake front—and there it would soon be all ice

First he went to the steel mill and the harvester works, and found that his places there had been filled long ago

He watched the newspapers, too—but no longer was he to be taken in by smooth-spoken agents

In the end it was through a newspaper that he got a job, after nearly a month of seeking

Men threatened him and tried to throw him out, but he cursed and made a disturbance to attract a policeman, upon which they subsided, knowing that if the latter interfered it would be to “fire” them all

An hour or two later he entered a room and confronted a big Irishman behind a desk

“Ever worked in Chicago before.” the man inquired; and whether it was a good angel that put it into Jurgis’s mind, or an intuition of his sharpened wits, he was moved to answer, “No, sir.”

“Where do you come from.”

“Kansas City, sir.”

“Any references.”

“No, sir

I’m just an unskilled man

“I want men for hard work—it’s all underground, digging tunnels for telephones

“I’m willing, sir—anything for me

“Fifteen cents an hour.”

“I’m willing, sir.”

“All right; go back there and give your name.”

So within half an hour he was at work, far underneath the streets of the city

Stranger yet, the tunnel was lighted by electricity, and upon it was laid a double-tracked, narrow-gauge railroad

But Jurgis was not there to ask questions, and he did not give the matter a thought

The aldermen declared that they had had no idea of it all, in spite of the fact that the main entrance to the work had been in the rear of the saloon of one of them

It was in a newly opened cut that Jurgis worked, and so he knew that he had an all-winter job

There was one belonging to a Hebrew collar button peddler, who had died in the room next to him, and which the landlady was holding for her rent; in the end, however, Jurgis decided to do without it, as he was to be underground by day and in bed at night

This was an unfortunate decision, however, for it drove him more quickly than ever into the saloons

It was for such pleasures as these that he spent his money; and such was his life during the six weeks and a half that he toiled for the merchants of Chicago, to enable them to break the grip of their teamsters’ union

In a work thus carried out, not much thought was given to the welfare of the laborers

So it was that one night, as Jurgis was on his way out with his gang, an engine and a loaded car dashed round one of the innumerable right-angle branches and struck him upon the shoulder, hurling him against the concrete wall and knocking him senseless

When he opened his eyes again it was to the clanging of the bell of an ambulance

They took him to the county hospital, where a young surgeon set his arm; then he was washed and laid upon a bed in a ward with a score or two more of maimed and mangled men

Jurgis spent his Christmas in this hospital, and it was the pleasantest Christmas he had had in America

Jurgis had often wondered just who ate the canned corned beef and “roast beef” of the stockyards; now he began to understand—that it was what you might call “graft meat,” put up to be sold to public officials and contractors, and eaten by soldiers and sailors, prisoners and inmates of institutions, “shantymen” and gangs of railroad laborers

Jurgis was ready to leave the hospital at the end of two weeks

That he was utterly helpless, and had no means of keeping himself alive in the meantime, was something which did not concern the hospital authorities, nor any one else in the city

As it chanced, he had been hurt on a Monday, and had just paid for his last week’s board and his room rent, and spent nearly all the balance of his Saturday’s pay

As he must certainly be helpless for a couple of months, and had boarded there only six weeks, she decided very quickly that it would not be worth the risk to keep him on trust

So Jurgis went out into the streets, in a most dreadful plight

Even if he took to begging, he would be at a disadvantage, for reasons which he was to discover in good time

In the beginning he could not think of anything except getting out of the awful cold

That Jurgis was an old customer entitled him to a somewhat longer stop; but then he had been away two weeks, and was evidently “on the bum.” He might plead and tell his “hard luck story,” but that would not help him much; a saloon-keeper who was to be moved by such means would soon have his place jammed to the doors with “hoboes” on a day like this

So Jurgis went out into another place, and paid another nickel

If he does not, some one else will; and the saloon-keeper, unless he is also an alderman, is apt to be in debt to the big brewers, and on the verge of being sold out

The market for “sitters” was glutted that afternoon, however, and there was no place for Jurgis

At the last place, however, there was a bartender who knew him and liked him, and let him doze at one of the tables until the boss came back; and also, as he was going out, the man gave him a tip—on the next block there was a religious revival of some sort, with preaching and singing, and hundreds of hoboes would go there for the shelter and warmth

Jurgis went straightway, and saw a sign hung out, saying that the door would open at seven-thirty; then he walked, or half ran, a block, and hid awhile in a doorway and then ran again, and so on until the hour

At the end he was all but frozen, and fought his way in with the rest of the throng (at the risk of having his arm broken again), and got close to the big stove

By eight o’clock the place was so crowded that the speakers ought to have been flattered; the aisles were filled halfway up, and at the door men were packed tight enough to walk upon

Jurgis heard smatterings of it, for the reason that terror kept him awake—he knew that he snored abominably, and to have been put out just then would have been like a sentence of death to him

The evangelist was preaching “sin and redemption,” the infinite grace of God and His pardon for human frailty

They were trying to save their souls—and who but a fool could fail to see that all that was the matter with their souls was that they had not been able to get a decent existence for their bodies

At eleven the meeting closed, and the desolate audience filed out into the snow, muttering curses upon the few traitors who had got repentance and gone up on the platform

He would be turned out of the lodging-house promptly at seven—they had the shelves which served as bunks so contrived that they could be dropped, and any man who was slow about obeying orders could be tumbled to the floor

This was one day, and the cold spell lasted for fourteen of them

At the end of six days every cent of Jurgis’ money was gone; and then he went out on the streets to beg for his life

He would begin as soon as the business of the city was moving

Part of the saloon-keeper’s business was to offer a home and refreshments to beggars in exchange for the proceeds of their foragings; and was there any one else in the whole city who would do this—would the victim have done it himself

Poor Jurgis might have been expected to make a successful beggar

Every day the police net would drag hundreds of them off the streets, and in the detention hospital you might see them, herded together in a miniature inferno, with hideous, beastly faces, bloated and leprous with disease, laughing, shouting, screaming in all stages of drunkenness, barking like dogs, gibbering like apes, raving and tearing themselves in delirium

CHAPTER XXIV

In the face of all his handicaps, Jurgis was obliged to make the price of a lodging, and of a drink every hour or two, under penalty of freezing to death

There was no place for him anywhere—every direction he turned his gaze, this fact was forced upon him: Everything was built to express it to him: the residences, with their heavy walls and bolted doors, and basement windows barred with iron; the great warehouses filled with the products of the whole world, and guarded by iron shutters and heavy gates; the banks with their unthinkable billions of wealth, all buried in safes and vaults of steel

And then one day there befell Jurgis the one adventure of his life

When he stopped again he saw a man coming toward him, and placed himself in his path

“Please, sir,” he began, in the usual formula, “will you give me the price of a lodging

I’m an honest working-man, sir, and I never begged before

Jurgis usually went on until he was interrupted, but this man did not interrupt, and so at last he came to a breathless stop

“Whuzzat you say.” he queried suddenly, in a thick voice

Jurgis began again, speaking more slowly and distinctly; before he was half through the other put out his hand and rested it upon his shoulder

“Poor ole chappie.” he said

Then he lurched toward Jurgis, and the hand upon his shoulder became an arm about his neck

“Up against it myself, ole sport,” he said

They were close to a lamppost, and Jurgis got a glimpse of the other

“I’ve got cruel parents, or I’d set you up

“I’ve been in the hospital.”

“Hospital.” exclaimed the young fellow, still smiling sweetly, “thass too bad

Same’s my Aunt Polly—hic—my Aunt Polly’s in the hospital, too—ole auntie’s been havin’ twins

“I’ve got a broken arm—” Jurgis began

“So,” said the other, sympathetically

Then they’d treat me better—hic—hole me up, ole sport

“I’m hungry, sir,” said Jurgis

“Hungry

“I’ve got no money, sir.”

“No money

No money, either—a’most busted

“I haven’t any home,” said Jurgis

“No home

‘Lemme go, Kittens,’ says I—‘come early an’ often—I go where duty—hic—calls me

This last was a song, and the young gentleman’s voice rose mournful and wailing, while he swung upon Jurgis’s neck

They were still alone, however

“But I came all right, all right,” continued the youngster, aggressively, “I can—hic—I can have my own way when I want it, by Harry—Freddie Jones is a hard man to handle when he gets goin’

Hip

They had started down the street, arm in arm, the young man pushing Jurgis along, half dazed

It was only because of the falling snow that people who passed here did not notice anything wrong

Suddenly, therefore, Jurgis stopped

“Is it very far.” he inquired

“Not very,” said the other, “Tired, are you, though

Good

And then, gripping Jurgis tight with one hand, the young fellow began searching his pockets with the other

“You call, ole sport, an’ I’ll pay,” he suggested

And he pulled out from somewhere a big roll of bills

It was more money than Jurgis had ever seen in his life before, and he stared at it with startled eyes

“Looks like a lot, hey.” said Master Freddie, fumbling with it

‘Hangin’ on the verge of starvation,’ I says—‘for the honor of the family—hic—sen’ me some bread

After this fashion the young gentleman continued to prattle on—and meantime Jurgis was trembling with excitement

“Freddie” got one bill loose, and then stuffed the rest back into his trousers’ pocket

“Here, ole man,” he said, “you take it.” He held it out fluttering

Hey

A cab was driving by; and Jurgis sprang and called, and it swung round to the curb

Master Freddie clambered in with some difficulty, and Jurgis had started to follow, when the driver shouted: “Hi, there

Jurgis hesitated, and was half obeying; but his companion broke out: “Whuzzat

And the cabbie subsided, and Jurgis climbed in

He had the hundred safe, and he would have to be content with that

At the end of half an hour or so the cab stopped

“Here we are,” called the cabbie, and Jurgis awakened his companion

Master Freddie sat up with a start

“Hello.” he said

Br-r-r—it’s cold

Before them there loomed an enormous granite pile, set far back from the street, and occupying a whole block

But he followed in silence, and they went up the long flight of steps, arm in arm

“There’s a button here, ole sport,” said Master Freddie

Steady, now—oh, yes, here she is

A bell rang, and in a few seconds the door was opened

A man in blue livery stood holding it, and gazing before him, silent as a statue

They stood for a moment blinking in the light

Aladdin entering his cave could not have been more excited

The place where he stood was dimly lighted; but he could see a vast hall, with pillars fading into the darkness above, and a great staircase opening at the far end of it

The floor was of tesselated marble, smooth as glass, and from the walls strange shapes loomed out, woven into huge portieres in rich, harmonious colors, or gleaming from paintings, wonderful and mysterious-looking in the half-light, purple and red and golden, like sunset glimmers in a shadowy forest

The man in livery had moved silently toward them; Master Freddie took off his hat and handed it to him, and then, letting go of Jurgis’ arm, tried to get out of his overcoat

Then suddenly came Master Freddie’s voice, “Hamilton

The man paused and half released Jurgis

“Come ’long ole chappie,” said the other, and Jurgis started toward him

“Master Frederick.” exclaimed the man

“See that the cabbie—hic—is paid,” was the other’s response; and he linked his arm in Jurgis’

The stout man in uniform signaled to the other, who went out to the cab, while he followed Jurgis and his young master

They went down the great hall, and then turned

Before them were two huge doors

“Hamilton,” said Master Freddie

“Well, sir.” said the other

“Whuzzamatter wizze dinin’-room doors.”

“Nothing is the matter, sir.”

“Then why dontcha openum.”

The man rolled them back; another vista lost itself in the darkness

In the center of it was a huge carven bowl, with the glistening gleam of ferns and the red and purple of rare orchids, glowing from a light hidden somewhere in their midst

“This’s the dinin’ room,” observed Master Freddie

He always insisted on having an answer to his remarks, leaning over Jurgis and smiling into his face

Jurgis liked it

“Rummy ole place to feed in all ’lone, though,” was Freddie’s comment—“rummy’s hell

Whuzya think, hey.” Then another idea occurred to him and he went on, without waiting: “Maybe you never saw anythin—hic—like this ’fore

“No,” said Jurgis

“Come from country, maybe—hey.”

“Yes,” said Jurgis

“Aha

Bully place, though—worth seein’

Jurgis had started involuntarily; the other, whose sharp eyes missed nothing, demanded: “Whuzzamatter, hey

And Jurgis managed to stammer out: “I have worked for him in the yards.”

“What.” cried Master Freddie, with a yell

Me fren’, Mr—whuzya name, ole chappie

“Rudkus—Jurgis Rudkus.”

“My fren’, Mr Rednose, Hamilton—shake han’s.”

The stately butler bowed his head, but made not a sound; and suddenly Master Freddie pointed an eager finger at him

You think—hic—you think I’m drunk

And the butler again bowed his head

I’m drunk

The two waited until his fit had spent itself, to see what new whim would seize him

We’ll have some of the eighteen-thirty Madeira

“Yes, sir,” said the butler, “but, Master Frederick, your father left orders—”

And Master Frederick drew himself up to a stately height

“My father’s orders were left to me—hic—an’ not to you,” he said

“No, sir,” said the butler

“Guv’ner must be travelin’

“They are doing well, sir.”

“Good.” said Master Freddie; and added fervently: “God bless ’em, the little lambs.”

They went up the great staircase, one step at a time; at the top of it there gleamed at them out of the shadows the figure of a nymph crouching by a fountain, a figure ravishingly beautiful, the flesh warm and glowing with the hues of life

He opened a door before them, and then pressed another button, as they staggered into the apartment

It was fitted up as a study

Beyond, a door opened upon a bedroom, and beyond that was a swimming pool of the purest marble, that had cost about forty thousand dollars

Master Freddie stood for a moment or two, gazing about him; then out of the next room a dog emerged, a monstrous bulldog, the most hideous object that Jurgis had ever laid eyes upon

Ain’t he a daisy, though—blue ribbon at the New York show—eighty-five hundred at a clip

The speaker sank into one of the big armchairs, and Admiral Dewey crouched beneath it; he did not snarl again, but he never took his eyes off Jurgis

He was perfectly sober, was the Admiral

The butler had closed the door, and he stood by it, watching Jurgis every second

There were cold pates, and thin slices of meat, tiny bread and butter sandwiches with the crust cut off, a bowl of sliced peaches and cream (in January), little fancy cakes, pink and green and yellow and white, and half a dozen ice-cold bottles of wine

“Thass the stuff for you.” cried Master Freddie, exultantly, as he spied them

And he seated himself at the table; the waiter pulled a cork, and he took the bottle and poured three glasses of its contents in succession down his throat

Then he gave a long-drawn sigh, and cried again to Jurgis to seat himself

The butler held the chair at the opposite side of the table, and Jurgis thought it was to keep him out of it; but finally he understand that it was the other’s intention to put it under him, and so he sat down, cautiously and mistrustingly

They went, all save the butler

“You may go too, Hamilton,” he said

“Master Frederick—” the man began

“Go.” cried the youngster, angrily

The man went out and closed the door; Jurgis, who was as sharp as he, observed that he took the key out of the lock, in order that he might peer through the keyhole

Master Frederick turned to the table again

Jurgis gazed at him doubtingly

“Eat.” cried the other

“Don’t you want anything.” Jurgis asked

“Ain’t hungry,” was the reply—“only thirsty

So Jurgis began, without further parley

“Gee whiz.” said the other, who had been watching him in wonder

Then he held Jurgis the bottle

“Lessee you drink now,” he said; and Jurgis took the bottle and turned it up to his mouth, and a wonderfully unearthly liquid ecstasy poured down his throat, tickling every nerve of him, thrilling him with joy

“Good stuff, hey.” said Freddie, sympathetically; he had leaned back in the big chair, putting his arm behind his head and gazing at Jurgis

And Jurgis gazed back at him

Freddie was up in arms and meant serious business, as they would find in the end—if there was no other way of bringing them to terms he would have his “Kittens” wire that she was about to marry him, and see what happened then

So the cheerful youngster rattled on, until he was tired out

Then he opened them again, and smiled once more, and finally closed them and forgot to open them

For several minutes Jurgis sat perfectly motionless, watching him, and reveling in the strange sensation of the champagne

Once he stirred, and the dog growled; after that he sat almost holding his breath—until after a while the door of the room opened softly, and the butler came in

He walked toward Jurgis upon tiptoe, scowling at him; and Jurgis rose up, and retreated, scowling back

“Get out of here.” he whispered

Jurgis hesitated, giving a glance at Freddie, who was snoring softly

And Jurgis wavered but an instant more

Then he surrendered and started toward the door

They went out without a sound, and down the great echoing staircase, and through the dark hall

At the front door he paused, and the butler strode close to him

“Hold up your hands,” he snarled

Jurgis took a step back, clinching his one well fist

“What for.” he cried; and then understanding that the fellow proposed to search him, he answered, “I’ll see you in hell first.”

“Do you want to go to jail.” demanded the butler, menacingly

“Have ’em.” roared Jurgis, with fierce passion

“But you won’t put your hands on me till you do

So the butler, who was terrified lest his young master should waken, stepped suddenly to the door, and opened it

“Get out of here.” he said; and then as Jurgis passed through the opening, he gave him a ferocious kick that sent him down the great stone steps at a run, and landed him sprawling in the snow at the bottom

CHAPTER XXV

Jurgis got up, wild with rage, but the door was shut and the great castle was dark and impregnable

Then the icy teeth of the blast bit into him, and he turned and went away at a run

When he stopped again it was because he was coming to frequented streets and did not wish to attract attention

He put his hand into his trousers’ pocket every now and then, to make sure that the precious hundred-dollar bill was still there

Yet he was in a plight—a curious and even dreadful plight, when he came to realize it

And he had to find some shelter that night he had to change it

Jurgis spent half an hour walking and debating the problem

He might pay them to change it, if it could not be done otherwise

He began peering into places as he walked; he passed several as being too crowded—then finally, chancing upon one where the bartender was all alone, he gripped his hands in sudden resolution and went in

“Can you change me a hundred-dollar bill.” he demanded

The bartender was a big, husky fellow, with the jaw of a prize fighter, and a three weeks’ stubble of hair upon it

“What’s that youse say.” he demanded

“I said, could you change me a hundred-dollar bill.”

“Where’d youse get it.” he inquired incredulously

“Never mind,” said Jurgis; “I’ve got it, and I want it changed

The other stared at him hard

“Lemme see it,” he said

“Will you change it.” Jurgis demanded, gripping it tightly in his pocket

“How the hell can I know if it’s good or not.” retorted the bartender

Then Jurgis slowly and warily approached him; he took out the bill, and fumbled it for a moment, while the man stared at him with hostile eyes across the counter

Then finally he handed it over

The other took it, and began to examine it; he smoothed it between his fingers, and held it up to the light; he turned it over, and upside down, and edgeways

Jurgis was watching him like a cat all the time

“Humph,” he said, finally, and gazed at the stranger, sizing him up—a ragged, ill-smelling tramp, with no overcoat and one arm in a sling—and a hundred-dollar bill

“Want to buy anything.” he demanded

“Yes,” said Jurgis, “I’ll take a glass of beer.”

“All right,” said the other, “I’ll change it.” And he put the bill in his pocket, and poured Jurgis out a glass of beer, and set it on the counter

“There,” he said

For a second Jurgis waited, expecting to see him turn again

“My ninety-nine dollars,” he said

“What ninety-nine dollars.” demanded the bartender

“My change.” he cried—“the rest of my hundred.”

“Go on,” said the bartender, “you’re nutty.”

And Jurgis stared at him with wild eyes

Then, as Jurgis scrambled to his feet again and started round the counter after him, he shouted at the top of his voice, “Help

Jurgis seized a bottle off the counter as he ran; and as the bartender made a leap he hurled the missile at him with all his force

An instant later the screen doors flew open, and two men rushed in—just as Jurgis was getting to his feet again, foaming at the mouth with rage, and trying to tear his broken arm out of its bandages

“Look out.” shouted the bartender

“He’s got a knife.” Then, seeing that the two were disposed to join the fray, he made another rush at Jurgis, and knocked aside his feeble defense and sent him tumbling again; and the three flung themselves upon him, rolling and kicking about the place

A second later a policeman dashed in, and the bartender yelled once more—“Look out for his knife.” Jurgis had fought himself half to his knees, when the policeman made a leap at him, and cracked him across the face with his club

Then again the club descended, full upon his head, and he dropped like a log to the floor

The policeman crouched over him, clutching his stick, waiting for him to try to rise again; and meantime the barkeeper got up, and put his hand to his head

“Christ.” he said, “I thought I was done for that time

“Don’t see anything, Jake,” said the policeman

“Just crazy drunk,” said the other

“A lame duck, too—but he ’most got me under the bar

“No,” said the officer

“Git up here, you.” he commanded

But Jurgis did not move, and the bartender went behind the bar, and after stowing the hundred-dollar bill away in a safe hiding place, came and poured a glass of water over Jurgis

The station house was just around the corner, and so in a few minutes Jurgis was in a cell

He spent half the night lying unconscious, and the balance moaning in torment, with a blinding headache and a racking thirst

There were others in that same station house with split heads and a fever; there were hundreds of them in the great city, and tens of thousands of them in the great land, and there was no one to hear any of them

In the morning Jurgis was given a cup of water and a piece of bread, and then hustled into a patrol wagon and driven to the nearest police court

He sat in the pen with a score of others until his turn came

The bartender—who proved to be a well-known bruiser—was called to the stand

He had been given ninety-five cents’ change, and had demanded ninety-nine dollars more, and before the plaintiff could even answer had hurled the glass at him and then attacked him with a bottle of bitters, and nearly wrecked the place

Then the prisoner was sworn—a forlorn object, haggard and unshorn, with an arm done up in a filthy bandage, a cheek and head cut, and bloody, and one eye purplish black and entirely closed

“What have you to say for yourself.” queried the magistrate

“Your Honor,” said Jurgis, “I went into his place and asked the man if he could change me a hundred-dollar bill

And he said he would if I bought a drink

The magistrate was staring at him in perplexity

“You gave him a hundred-dollar bill.” he exclaimed

“Yes, your Honor,” said Jurgis

“Where did you get it.”

“A man gave it to me, your Honor.”

“A man

“A young man I met upon the street, your Honor

There was a titter in the courtroom; the officer who was holding Jurgis put up his hand to hide a smile, and the magistrate smiled without trying to hide it

“It’s true, your Honor.” cried Jurgis, passionately

“You had been drinking as well as begging last night, had you not.” inquired the magistrate

“No, your Honor—” protested Jurgis

“You had not had anything to drink.”

“Why, yes, your Honor, I had—”

“What did you have.”

“I had a bottle of something—I don’t know what it was—something that burned—”

There was again a laugh round the courtroom, stopping suddenly as the magistrate looked up and frowned

“Have you ever been arrested before.” he asked abruptly

The question took Jurgis aback

“I—I—” he stammered

“Tell me the truth, now.” commanded the other, sternly

“Yes, your Honor,” said Jurgis

“How often.”

“Only once, your Honor.”

“What for.”

“For knocking down my boss, your Honor

“I see,” said his Honor; “I guess that will do

Ten days and costs

Jurgis gave vent to a cry of dismay, cut off suddenly by the policeman, who seized him by the collar

It seemed monstrous to him that policemen and judges should esteem his word as nothing in comparison with the bartender’s—poor Jurgis could not know that the owner of the saloon paid five dollars each week to the policeman alone for Sunday privileges and general favors—nor that the pugilist bartender was one of the most trusted henchmen of the Democratic leader of the district, and had helped only a few months before to hustle out a record-breaking vote as a testimonial to the magistrate, who had been made the target of odious kid-gloved reformers

Jurgis was driven out to the Bridewell for the second time

Also his head and his eye had to be tied up—and so he was a pretty-looking object when, the second day after his arrival, he went out into the exercise court and encountered—Jack Duane

The young fellow was so glad to see Jurgis that he almost hugged him

“By God, if it isn’t ‘the Stinker’.” he cried

“No,” said Jurgis, “but I’ve been in a railroad wreck and a fight.” And then, while some of the other prisoners gathered round he told his wild story; most of them were incredulous, but Duane knew that Jurgis could never have made up such a yarn as that

“Hard luck, old man,” he said, when they were alone; “but maybe it’s taught you a lesson.”

“I’ve learned some things since I saw you last,” said Jurgis mournfully

“And you.” he asked finally

“Lord, no.” said the other

It’s the second time they’ve sent me up on a trumped-up charge—I’ve had hard luck and can’t pay them what they want

“I’ve no place to go,” said Jurgis, sadly

“Neither have I,” replied the other, laughing lightly

In the Bridewell Jurgis met few who had been there the last time, but he met scores of others, old and young, of exactly the same sort

The last time he was there, Jurgis had thought of little but his family; but now he was free to listen to these men, and to realize that he was one of them—that their point of view was his point of view, and that the way they kept themselves alive in the world was the way he meant to do it in the future

And so, when he was turned out of prison again, without a penny in his pocket, he went straight to Jack Duane

Jurgis could not see what help he could be to him; but he did not understand that a man like himself—who could be trusted to stand by any one who was kind to him—was as rare among criminals as among any other class of men

The address Jurgis had was a garret room in the Ghetto district, the home of a pretty little French girl, Duane’s mistress, who sewed all day, and eked out her living by prostitution

The new address was a cellar dive, whose proprietor said that he had never heard of Duane; but after he had put Jurgis through a catechism he showed him a back stairs which led to a “fence” in the rear of a pawnbroker’s shop, and thence to a number of assignation rooms, in one of which Duane was hiding

Duane was glad to see him; he was without a cent of money, he said, and had been waiting for Jurgis to help him get some

Also Rosensteg, the pawnbroker, would buy anything he had for a third of its value, and guarantee to keep it hidden for a year

There was an oil stove in the little cupboard of a room, and they had some supper; and then about eleven o’clock at night they sallied forth together, by a rear entrance to the place, Duane armed with a slingshot

They came to a residence district, and he sprang up a lamppost and blew out the light, and then the two dodged into the shelter of an area step and hid in silence

Pretty soon a man came by, a workingman—and they let him go

Then Jurgis went one way and his friend the other, walking briskly

The latter arrived first, and Jurgis found him examining the “swag.” There was a gold watch, for one thing, with a chain and locket; there was a silver pencil, and a matchbox, and a handful of small change, and finally a card-case

“That lets us out.” he said

After further examination, they burned the card-case and its contents, all but the bills, and likewise the picture of a little girl in the locket

“The old scoundrel said the case was filled,” he said

They divided up the spoils, and Jurgis got as his share fifty-five dollars and some change

That was a good haul, he said, better than average

When they got up in the morning, Jurgis was sent out to buy a paper; one of the pleasures of committing a crime was the reading about it afterward

There was a half-column account of the robbery—it was evident that a gang was operating in the neighborhood, said the paper, for it was the third within a week, and the police were apparently powerless

The enterprising newspaper reporter had taken all this information to his family, and told how they had received it

Since it was Jurgis’s first experience, these details naturally caused him some worriment; but the other laughed coolly—it was the way of the game, and there was no helping it

“It’s a case of us or the other fellow, and I say the other fellow, every time,” he observed

“Still,” said Jurgis, reflectively, “he never did us any harm.”

“He was doing it to somebody as hard as he could, you can be sure of that,” said his friend

Duane had already explained to Jurgis that if a man of their trade were known he would have to work all the time to satisfy the demands of the police

Duane, who had done a job of some sort by himself, and made a truce with the powers, brought over Marie, his little French girl, to share with him; but even that did not avail for long, and in the end he had to give up arguing, and take Jurgis out and introduce him to the saloons and “sporting houses” where the big crooks and “holdup men” hung out

And so Jurgis got a glimpse of the high-class criminal world of Chicago

On election day all these powers of vice and crime were one power; they could tell within one per cent what the vote of their district would be, and they could change it at an hour’s notice

A month ago Jurgis had all but perished of starvation upon the streets; and now suddenly, as by the gift of a magic key, he had entered into a world where money and all the good things of life came freely

As Jurgis was excellent at keeping quiet, he soon won the trust of “Buck” Halloran, and was introduced to others as a man who could be depended upon

This acquaintance was useful to him in another way, also before long Jurgis made his discovery of the meaning of “pull,” and just why his boss, Connor, and also the pugilist bartender, had been able to send him to jail

When he was arraigned that same morning, the district leader had already seen the clerk of the court and explained that Jurgis Rudkus was a decent fellow, who had been indiscreet; and so Jurgis was fined ten dollars and the fine was “suspended”—which meant that he did not have to pay for it, and never would have to pay it, unless somebody chose to bring it up against him in the future

Among the people Jurgis lived with now money was valued according to an entirely different standard from that of the people of Packingtown; yet, strange as it may seem, he did a great deal less drinking than he had as a workingman

He soon found that if he kept his wits about him, he would come upon new opportunities; and being naturally an active man, he not only kept sober himself, but helped to steady his friend, who was a good deal fonder of both wine and women than he

One thing led to another

Occasionally there was no way of satisfying them but to let them search the place to which the girl had been traced

For his help in this little job, the bartender received twenty out of the hundred and thirty odd dollars that the pair secured; and naturally this put them on friendly terms with him, and a few days later he introduced them to a little “sheeny” named Goldberger, one of the “runners” of the “sporting house” where they had been hidden

Duane took all this in at once, but Jurgis had to have the whole race-track situation explained to him before he realized the importance of such an opportunity

There was the gigantic Racing Trust

For a secret like that they would have done a good many sluggings—but the next day Goldberger informed them that the offending gambler had got wind of what was coming to him, and had skipped the town

There were ups and downs at the business; but there was always a living, inside of a jail, if not out of it

At the last election the Republicans had paid four dollars a vote to the Democrats’ three; and “Buck” Halloran sat one night playing cards with Jurgis and another man, who told how Halloran had been charged with the job voting a “bunch” of thirty-seven newly landed Italians, and how he, the narrator, had met the Republican worker who was after the very same gang, and how the three had effected a bargain, whereby the Italians were to vote half and half, for a glass of beer apiece, while the balance of the fund went to the conspirators

Not long after this, Jurgis, wearying of the risks and vicissitudes of miscellaneous crime, was moved to give up the career for that of a politician

The people of Packingtown had borne about all that they would bear, and it looked as if a strike might begin any week

After this talk the man made inquiries concerning Jurgis, and a couple of days later he came to him with an interesting proposition

Surely Jurgis must know hundreds of men who would like that sort of fun; and there would be the regular Republican leaders and workers to help him out, and they would deliver a big enough majority on election day

When he had heard all this explanation to the end, Jurgis demanded: “But how can I get a job in Packingtown

At which “Bush” Harper laughed

“I’ll attend to that all right,” he said

And the other replied, “It’s a go, then; I’m your man.” So Jurgis went out to the stockyards again, and was introduced to the political lord of the district, the boss of Chicago’s mayor

To him Scully was a mighty power, the “biggest” man he had ever met

He was a little, dried-up Irishman, whose hands shook

“The bearer, Jurgis Rudkus, is a particular friend of mine, and I would like you to find him a good place, for important reasons

Mr Harmon looked up inquiringly when he read this

“What does he mean by ‘indiscreet’.” he asked

“I was blacklisted, sir,” said Jurgis

At which the other frowned

“How do you mean.” And Jurgis turned red with embarrassment

He had forgotten that a blacklist did not exist

“I—that is—I had difficulty in getting a place,” he stammered

“What was the matter.”

“I got into a quarrel with a foreman—not my own boss, sir—and struck him.”

“I see,” said the other, and meditated for a few moments

“What do you wish to do.” he asked

“Anything, sir,” said Jurgis—“only I had a broken arm this winter, and so I have to be careful.”

“How would it suit you to be a night watchman.”

“That wouldn’t do, sir

“I see—politics

“Yes, sir,” said Jurgis

And Mr Harmon called a timekeeper and said, “Take this man to Pat Murphy and tell him to find room for him somehow.”

And so Jurgis marched into the hog-killing room, a place where, in the days gone by, he had come begging for a job

And so Jurgis became a workingman once more; and straightway he sought out his old friends, and joined the union, and began to “root” for “Scotty” Doyle

His inspiriting address was quoted to the extent of half a column in all the morning newspapers, which also said that it could be stated upon excellent authority that the unexpected popularity developed by Doyle, the Republican candidate for alderman, was giving great anxiety to Mr Scully, the chairman of the Democratic City Committee

The chairman was still more worried when the monster torchlight procession came off, with the members of the Doyle Republican Association all in red capes and hats, and free beer for every voter in the ward—the best beer ever given away in a political campaign, as the whole electorate testified

After that Jurgis did his best to please them, and to make up for the time he had lost before he discovered the extra bungholes of the campaign barrel

He pleased Mike Scully, also

The balance all went for actual votes, and on a day of Democratic landslides they elected “Scotty” Doyle, the ex-tenpin setter, by nearly a thousand plurality—and beginning at five o’clock in the afternoon, and ending at three the next morning, Jurgis treated himself to a most unholy and horrible “jag.” Nearly every one else in Packingtown did the same, however, for there was universal exultation over this triumph of popular government, this crushing defeat of an arrogant plutocrat by the power of the common people

CHAPTER XXVI

After the elections Jurgis stayed on in Packingtown and kept his job

Besides, Mike Scully, whom he consulted, advised him that something might “turn up” before long

Jurgis got himself a place in a boardinghouse with some congenial friends

He had some reason for thinking of his dress, for he was making about eleven dollars a week, and two-thirds of it he might spend upon his pleasures without ever touching his savings

Sometimes he would ride down-town with a party of friends to the cheap theaters and the music halls and other haunts with which they were familiar

During all this time the same man and woman would dance together, half-stupefied with sensuality and drink

Before long Jurgis discovered what Scully had meant by something “turning up.” In May the agreement between the packers and the unions expired, and a new agreement had to be signed

Not much

All this was in June; and before long the question was submitted to a referendum in the unions, and the decision was for a strike

Louis, and New York—and the next day at noon between fifty and sixty thousand men drew off their working clothes and marched out of the factories, and the great “Beef Strike” was on

Jurgis went to his dinner, and afterward he walked over to see Mike Scully, who lived in a fine house, upon a street which had been decently paved and lighted for his especial benefit

“What do you want.” he demanded, when he saw Jurgis

“I came to see if maybe you could get me a place during the strike,” the other replied

And Scully knit his brows and eyed him narrowly

In that morning’s papers Jurgis had read a fierce denunciation of the packers by Scully, who had declared that if they did not treat their people better the city authorities would end the matter by tearing down their plants

Jurgis started

“Work as a scab.” he cried

“Why not.” demanded Scully

“But—but—” stammered Jurgis

“The packers need good men, and need them bad,” continued the other, “and they’ll treat a man right that stands by them

“But,” said Jurgis, “how could I ever be of any use to you—in politics.”

“You couldn’t be it anyhow,” said Scully, abruptly

“Why not.” asked Jurgis

“Hell, man.” cried the other

And do you think I’m always going to elect Republicans

Jurgis looked dumfounded

“I could be a Democrat,” he said

“Yes,” responded the other, “but not right away; a man can’t change his politics every day

And besides, I don’t need you—there’d be nothing for you to do

“I thought I could count on you,” began Jurgis

“Yes,” responded Scully, “so you could—I never yet went back on a friend

It wouldn’t do for me to tell other men what I tell you, but you’ve been on the inside, and you ought to have sense enough to see for yourself

“I hadn’t thought,” said Jurgis

“Exactly,” said Scully, “but you’d better

Take my word for it, the strike will be over in a few days, and the men will be beaten; and meantime what you can get out of it will belong to you

And Jurgis saw

The men had left a long line of hogs in various stages of preparation, and the foreman was directing the feeble efforts of a score or two of clerks and stenographers and office boys to finish up the job and get them into the chilling rooms

The boss’s face lighted up

“Good man.” he cried

“Just a moment,” said Jurgis, checking his enthusiasm

“Yes,” replied the other, “of course

Jurgis had debated on the way

“I think I ought to have’ three dollars a day,” he said

“All right,” said the other, promptly; and before the day was out our friend discovered that the clerks and stenographers and office boys were getting five dollars a day, and then he could have kicked himself

So Jurgis became one of the new “American heroes,” a man whose virtues merited comparison with those of the martyrs of Lexington and Valley Forge

Jurgis knew nothing of this, but went back to “Packers’ Avenue,” and in front of the “Central Time Station” he saw one of his companions, breathless and wild with excitement, narrating to an ever growing throng how the four had been attacked and surrounded by a howling mob, and had been nearly torn to pieces

VIOLENCE IN THE YARDS

STRIKEBREAKERS SURROUNDED BY FRENZIED MOB

If he had been able to buy all of the newspapers of the United States the next morning, he might have discovered that his beer-hunting exploit was being perused by some two score millions of people, and had served as a text for editorials in half the staid and solemn business-men’s newspapers in the land

Jurgis was to see more of this as time passed

They had been attracted more by the prospect of disorder than by the big wages; and they made the night hideous with singing and carousing, and only went to sleep when the time came for them to get up to work

In the morning before Jurgis had finished his breakfast, “Pat” Murphy ordered him to one of the superintendents, who questioned him as to his experience in the work of the killing room

His heart began to thump with excitement, for he divined instantly that his hour had come—that he was to be a boss

Some of the foremen were union members, and many who were not had gone out with the men

It was in the killing department that the packers had been left most in the lurch, and precisely here that they could least afford it; the smoking and canning and salting of meat might wait, and all the by-products might be wasted—but fresh meats must be had, or the restaurants and hotels and brownstone houses would feel the pinch, and then “public opinion” would take a startling turn

An opportunity such as this would not come twice to a man; and Jurgis seized it

Jurgis would receive five dollars a day during the strike, and twenty-five a week after it was settled

So our friend got a pair of “slaughter pen” boots and “jeans,” and flung himself at his task

It was a weird sight, there on the killing beds—a throng of stupid black Negroes, and foreigners who could not understand a word that was said to them, mixed with pale-faced, hollow-chested bookkeepers and clerks, half-fainting for the tropical heat and the sickening stench of fresh blood—and all struggling to dress a dozen or two cattle in the same place where, twenty-four hours ago, the old killing gang had been speeding, with their marvelous precision, turning out four hundred carcasses every hour

The Negroes and the “toughs” from the Lêvée did not want to work, and every few minutes some of them would feel obliged to retire and recuperate

As for the poor office employees, they did their best, moved to it by terror; thirty of them had been “fired” in a bunch that first morning for refusing to serve, besides a number of women clerks and typewriters who had declined to act as waitresses

It was such a force as this that Jurgis had to organize

After the first meal nearly all the steel knives had been missing, and now every Negro had one, ground to a fine point, hidden in his boots

There was no bringing order out of such a chaos, Jurgis soon discovered; and he fell in with the spirit of the thing—there was no reason why he should wear himself out with shouting

Of course, before long this custom spread, and Jurgis was soon making quite a good income from it

In the face of handicaps such as these the packers counted themselves lucky if they could kill off the cattle that had been crippled in transit and the hogs that had developed disease

In some places they would use the same room for eating and sleeping, and at night the men would put their cots upon the tables, to keep away from the swarms of rats

But with all their best efforts, the packers were demoralized

They made an offer to submit the whole question at issue to arbitration; and at the end of ten days the unions accepted it, and the strike was called off

This was an anxious time for Jurgis

He sought out the superintendent, who smiled grimly and bade him “wait and see.” Durham’s strikebreakers were few of them leaving

Whether or not the “settlement” was simply a trick of the packers to gain time, or whether they really expected to break the strike and cripple the unions by the plan, cannot be said; but that night there went out from the office of Durham and Company a telegram to all the big packing centers, “Employ no union leaders.” And in the morning, when the twenty thousand men thronged into the yards, with their dinner pails and working clothes, Jurgis stood near the door of the hog-trimming room, where he had worked before the strike, and saw a throng of eager men, with a score or two of policemen watching them; and he saw a superintendent come out and walk down the line, and pick out man after man that pleased him; and one after another came, and there were some men up near the head of the line who were never picked—they being the union stewards and delegates, and the men Jurgis had heard making speeches at the meetings

“We all go back or none of us do.” cried a hundred voices

Then suddenly the big butcher president leaped upon a pile of stones and yelled: “It’s off, boys

Men who had already got to work on the killing beds dropped their tools and joined them; some galloped here and there on horseback, shouting the tidings, and within half an hour the whole of Packingtown was on strike again, and beside itself with fury

There was quite a different tone in Packingtown after this—the place was a seething caldron of passion, and the “scab” who ventured into it fared badly

There was no one to picture the battle the union leaders were fighting—to hold this huge army in rank, to keep it from straggling and pillaging, to cheer and encourage and guide a hundred thousand people, of a dozen different tongues, through six long weeks of hunger and disappointment and despair

Meantime the packers had set themselves definitely to the task of making a new labor force

And when the clamor of the public led to an investigation into these conditions, and the mayor of the city was forced to order the enforcement of the law, the packers got a judge to issue an injunction forbidding him to do it

Just at this time the mayor was boasting that he had put an end to gambling and prize fighting in the city; but here a swarm of professional gamblers had leagued themselves with the police to fleece the strikebreakers; and any night, in the big open space in front of Brown’s, one might see brawny Negroes stripped to the waist and pounding each other for money, while a howling throng of three or four thousand surged about, men and women, young white girls from the country rubbing elbows with big buck Negroes with daggers in their boots, while rows of woolly heads peered down from every window of the surrounding factories

And as the women were the dregs from the brothels of Chicago, and the men were for the most part ignorant country Negroes, the nameless diseases of vice were soon rife; and this where food was being handled which was sent out to every corner of the civilized world

The “Union Stockyards” were never a pleasant place; but now they were not only a collection of slaughterhouses, but also the camping place of an army of fifteen or twenty thousand human beasts

All day long the blazing midsummer sun beat down upon that square mile of abominations: upon tens of thousands of cattle crowded into pens whose wooden floors stank and steamed contagion; upon bare, blistering, cinder-strewn railroad tracks, and huge blocks of dingy meat factories, whose labyrinthine passages defied a breath of fresh air to penetrate them; and there were not merely rivers of hot blood, and car-loads of moist flesh, and rendering vats and soap caldrons, glue factories and fertilizer tanks, that smelt like the craters of hell—there were also tons of garbage festering in the sun, and the greasy laundry of the workers hung out to dry, and dining rooms littered with food and black with flies, and toilet rooms that were open sewers

And then at night, when this throng poured out into the streets to play—fighting, gambling, drinking and carousing, cursing and screaming, laughing and singing, playing banjoes and dancing

They were worked in the yards all the seven days of the week, and they had their prize fights and crap games on Sunday nights as well; but then around the corner one might see a bonfire blazing, and an old, gray-headed Negress, lean and witchlike, her hair flying wild and her eyes blazing, yelling and chanting of the fires of perdition and the blood of the “Lamb,” while men and women lay down upon the ground and moaned and screamed in convulsions of terror and remorse

Such were the stockyards during the strike; while the unions watched in sullen despair, and the country clamored like a greedy child for its food, and the packers went grimly on their way

He was drinking, and developing a villainous temper, and he stormed and cursed and raged at his men, and drove them until they were ready to drop with exhaustion

Then one day late in August, a superintendent ran into the place and shouted to Jurgis and his gang to drop their work and come

Some steers had just escaped from the yards, and the strikers had got hold of them, and there would be the chance of a scrap

They went out at the Ashland Avenue gate, and over in the direction of the “dump.” There was a yell as soon as they were sighted, men and women rushing out of houses and saloons as they galloped by

If he fled into a house his pursuer would smash in the flimsy door and follow him up the stairs, hitting every one who came within reach, and finally dragging his squealing quarry from under a bed or a pile of old clothes in a closet

Jurgis and two policemen chased some men into a bar-room

These bricks and stones would figure in the accounts of the “riot” which would be sent out to a few thousand newspapers within an hour or two; but the episode of the cash drawer would never be mentioned again, save only in the heartbreaking legends of Packingtown

It was late in the afternoon when they got back, and they dressed out the remainder of the steer, and a couple of others that had been killed, and then knocked off for the day

To console himself he had to drink a good deal, and he went back to Packingtown about two o’clock in the morning, very much the worse for his excursion, and, it must be confessed, entirely deserving the calamity that was in store for him

As he was going to the place where he slept, he met a painted-cheeked woman in a greasy “kimono,” and she put her arm about his waist to steady him; they turned into a dark room they were passing—but scarcely had they taken two steps before suddenly a door swung open, and a man entered, carrying a lantern

The man was Connor

Connor, the boss of the loading gang

He stood there, staring, with the light shining full upon him

Jurgis had often thought of Connor since coming back to Packingtown, but it had been as of something far off, that no longer concerned him

And he flung himself at the man, and smote him between the eyes—and then, as he fell, seized him by the throat and began to pound his head upon the stones

The woman began screaming, and people came rushing in

Precisely as before, Jurgis came away with a piece of his enemy’s flesh between his teeth; and, as before, he went on fighting with those who had interfered with him, until a policeman had come and beaten him into insensibility

And so Jurgis spent the balance of the night in the stockyards station house

Jurgis was wild about this, because a different magistrate had chanced to be on the bench, and he had stated that he had never been arrested before, and also that he had been attacked first—and if only someone had been there to speak a good word for him, he could have been let off at once

But Harper explained that he had been downtown, and had not got the message

“What’s happened to you.” he asked

“I’ve been doing a fellow up,” said Jurgis, “and I’ve got to get five hundred dollars’ bail.”

“I can arrange that all right,” said the other—“though it may cost you a few dollars, of course

“It was a man that did me a mean trick once,” answered Jurgis

“Who is he.”

“He’s a foreman in Brown’s or used to be

And the other gave a start

“Connor.” he cried

“Yes,” said Jurgis, “that’s the fellow

“Good God.” exclaimed the other, “then you’re in for it, old man

“Not help me

“Why, he’s one of Scully’s biggest men—he’s a member of the War-Whoop League, and they talked of sending him to the legislature

Phil Connor

Jurgis sat dumb with dismay

“Why, he can send you to Joliet, if he wants to.” declared the other

“Can’t I have Scully get me off before he finds out about it.” asked Jurgis, at length

“But Scully’s out of town,” the other answered

That was a pretty mess, indeed

“But what am I going to do.” he asked, weakly

“How should I know.” said the other

Again there was silence

“But what good would that do you when you came to stand trial.” asked Harper

“There’s nothing—unless it’s this,” he said

“How much will it be.” Jurgis asked, after he had had this explained more in detail

“I don’t know,” said the other

“I’ve got about three hundred dollars,” was the answer

“Well,” was Harper’s reply, “I’m not sure, but I’ll try and get you off for that

And so finally Jurgis ripped out his bankbook—which was sewed up in his trousers—and signed an order, which “Bush” Harper wrote, for all the money to be paid out

All that he told Jurgis was that he was now free, and that the best thing he could do was to clear out as quickly as possible; and so Jurgis overwhelmed with gratitude and relief, took the dollar and fourteen cents that was left him out of all his bank account, and put it with the two dollars and quarter that was left from his last night’s celebration, and boarded a streetcar and got off at the other end of Chicago

CHAPTER XXVII

Poor Jurgis was now an outcast and a tramp once more

His old companions would betray him, for the sake of the influence they would gain thereby; and he would be made to suffer, not merely for the offense he had committed, but for others which would be laid at his door, just as had been done for some poor devil on the occasion of that assault upon the “country customer” by him and Duane

And also he labored under another handicap now

The craving for it was strong enough to master every other consideration—he would have it, though it were his last nickel and he had to starve the balance of the day in consequence

Jurgis became once more a besieger of factory gates

Everywhere Jurgis went he kept meeting them, and he was in an agony of fear lest some one of them should know that he was “wanted.” He would have left Chicago, only by the time he had realized his danger he was almost penniless; and it would be better to go to jail than to be caught out in the country in the winter time

At the end of about ten days Jurgis had only a few pennies left; and he had not yet found a job—not even a day’s work at anything, not a chance to carry a satchel

There is one kind of prison where the man is behind bars, and everything that he desires is outside; and there is another kind where the things are behind the bars, and the man is outside

When he was down to his last quarter, Jurgis learned that before the bakeshops closed at night they sold out what was left at half price, and after that he would go and get two loaves of stale bread for a nickel, and break them up and stuff his pockets with them, munching a bit from time to time

He would not spend a penny save for this; and, after two or three days more, he even became sparing of the bread, and would stop and peer into the ash barrels as he walked along the streets, and now and then rake out a bit of something, shake it free from dust, and count himself just so many minutes further from the end

So for several days he had been going about, ravenous all the time, and growing weaker and weaker, and then one morning he had a hideous experience, that almost broke his heart

He would come back there after dark, and he would show that scoundrel whether he was good for anything or not

He was still muttering this when suddenly, at the corner, he came upon a green-grocery, with a tray full of cabbages in front of it

When he had gotten a safe distance away he sat down and devoured half the cabbage raw, stowing the balance away in his pockets till the next day

Just about this time one of the Chicago newspapers, which made much of the “common people,” opened a “free-soup kitchen” for the benefit of the unemployed

When Jurgis heard of this, from a fellow “hobo,” he vowed that he would have half a dozen bowls before morning; but, as it proved, he was lucky to get one, for there was a line of men two blocks long before the stand, and there was just as long a line when the place was finally closed up

This depot was within the danger line for Jurgis—in the “Lêvée” district, where he was known; but he went there, all the same, for he was desperate, and beginning to think of even the Bridewell as a place of refuge

That day Jurgis bought two drinks for the sake of the shelter, and at night he spent his last two pennies in a “stale-beer dive.” This was a place kept by a Negro, who went out and drew off the old dregs of beer that lay in barrels set outside of the saloons; and after he had doctored it with chemicals to make it “fizz,” he sold it for two cents a can, the purchase of a can including the privilege of sleeping the night through upon the floor, with a mass of degraded outcasts, men and women

All these horrors afflicted Jurgis all the more cruelly, because he was always contrasting them with the opportunities he had lost

For instance, just now it was election time again—within five or six weeks the voters of the country would select a President; and he heard the wretches with whom he associated discussing it, and saw the streets of the city decorated with placards and banners—and what words could describe the pangs of grief and despair that shot through him

For instance, there was a night during this cold spell

And then, through the rain and the darkness, far down the street he saw red lights flaring and heard the thumping of a bass drum; and his heart gave a leap, and he made for the place on the run—knowing without the asking that it meant a political meeting

The campaign had so far been characterized by what the newspapers termed “apathy.” For some reason the people refused to get excited over the struggle, and it was almost impossible to get them to come to meetings, or to make any noise when they did come

And then on the morrow the newspapers would have a chance to report the tremendous ovation, and to add that it had been no “silk-stocking” audience, either, proving clearly that the high tariff sentiments of the distinguished candidate were pleasing to the wage-earners of the nation

So Jurgis found himself in a large hall, elaborately decorated with flags and bunting; and after the chairman had made his little speech, and the orator of the evening rose up, amid an uproar from the band—only fancy the emotions of Jurgis upon making the discovery that the personage was none other than the famous and eloquent Senator Spareshanks, who had addressed the “Doyle Republican Association” at the stockyards, and helped to elect Mike Scully’s tenpin setter to the Chicago Board of Aldermen

In truth, the sight of the senator almost brought the tears into Jurgis’s eyes

And this was another election in which the Republicans had all the money; and but for that one hideous accident he might have had a share of it, instead of being where he was

The eloquent senator was explaining the system of protection; an ingenious device whereby the workingman permitted the manufacturer to charge him higher prices, in order that he might receive higher wages; thus taking his money out of his pocket with one hand, and putting a part of it back with the other

It was because of it that Columbia was the gem of the ocean; and all her future triumphs, her power and good repute among the nations, depended upon the zeal and fidelity with which each citizen held up the hands of those who were toiling to maintain it

And here the band began to play, and Jurgis sat up with a violent start

Go ahead, old sport.” And so the crowd roared, and the senator smiled genially, and went on; and in a few seconds poor Jurgis found himself landed out in the rain, with a kick and a string of curses

He got into the shelter of a doorway and took stock of himself

He had no money, and no place to sleep; he must begin begging again

He went out, hunching his shoulders together and shivering at the touch of the icy rain

“Please, ma’am,” he began, “could you lend me the price of a night’s lodging

Then, suddenly, he stopped short

He knew her

It was Alena Jasaityte, who had been the belle of his wedding feast

And now he met her here

She was as much surprised as he was

“Jurgis Rudkus.” she gasped

“I—I’ve had hard luck,” he stammered

“I’m out of work, and I’ve no home and no money

“No,” she answered, “I’m not married, but I’ve got a good place.”

They stood staring at each other for a few moments longer

“Jurgis,” she said, “I’d help you if I could, upon my word I would, but it happens that I’ve come out without my purse, and I honestly haven’t a penny with me: I can do something better for you, though—I can tell you how to get help

Jurgis gave a start

“Marija.” he exclaimed

“Yes,” said Alena; “and she’ll help you

It was not much more than a year since Jurgis had left Packingtown, feeling like one escaped from jail; and it had been from Marija and Elzbieta that he was escaping

He had a good excuse for running away—his grief at the death of his son; and also he had a good excuse for not returning—the fact that they had left Packingtown

So she gave him a number on Clark Street, adding, “There’s no need to give you my address, because Marija knows it.” And Jurgis set out, without further ado

A young colored girl came to the door, opening it about an inch, and gazing at him suspiciously

“What do you want.” she demanded

“Does Marija Berczynskas live here.” he inquired

“I dunno,” said the girl

“I want to see her,” said he; “she’s a relative of mine.”

The girl hesitated a moment

Then she opened the door and said, “Come in.” Jurgis came and stood in the hall, and she continued: “I’ll go see

“Tell her it’s Jurgis,” he answered, and the girl went upstairs

Jurgis’s heart went down into his boots

“De lady says dey ain’t no sich person here,” she said

And he stood for a moment, hesitating, helpless with dismay

Police

Jurgis stood for a second, bewildered

There was a young girl who had fainted, and two men who were supporting her; and there were a dozen others crowding toward the front door

Suddenly, however, there came a series of resounding blows upon it, causing the crowd to give back

At the same instant a stout woman, with painted cheeks and diamonds in her ears, came running down the stairs, panting breathlessly: “To the rear

She led the way to a back staircase, Jurgis following; in the kitchen she pressed a spring, and a cupboard gave way and opened, disclosing a dark passageway

Scarcely had the last one disappeared, however, before there were cries from in front, and then the panic-stricken throng poured out again, exclaiming: “They’re there too

“Upstairs.” cried the woman, and there was another rush of the mob, women and men cursing and screaming and fighting to be first

It was not to be stirred, however, and when the woman shouted up to unhook it, he answered: “It’s already unhooked

And a moment later came a voice from downstairs: “You might as well quit, you people

So the crowd subsided; and a few moments later several policemen came up, staring here and there, and leering at their victims

On the floor below four or five other girls sat upon trunks in the hall, making fun of the procession which filed by them

She heard him, and glanced around; then she shrank back and half sprang to her feet in amazement

“Jurgis.” she gasped

For a second or two they stood staring at each other

“How did you come here.” Marija exclaimed

“I came to see you,” he answered

“When.”

“Just now.”

“But how did you know—who told you I was here.”

“Alena Jasaityte

Again there was a silence, while they gazed at each other

“And you.” Jurgis asked

“Yes,” said Marija, “I live here.” Then suddenly came a hail from below: “Get your clothes on now, girls, and come along

“Br-r-r.” shivered some one, and the women got up and entered the various doors which lined the hallway

“Come,” said Marija, and took Jurgis into her room, which was a tiny place about eight by six, with a cot and a chair and a dressing stand and some dresses hanging behind the door

There were clothes scattered about on the floor, and hopeless confusion everywhere—boxes of rouge and bottles of perfume mixed with hats and soiled dishes on the dresser, and a pair of slippers and a clock and a whisky bottle on a chair

Marija had nothing on but a kimono and a pair of stockings; yet she proceeded to dress before Jurgis, and without even taking the trouble to close the door

What was he, to be pretending to decency

“How long have you been living here.” he asked

“Nearly a year,” she answered

“Why did you come.”

“I had to live,” she said; “and I couldn’t see the children starve.”

He paused for a moment, watching her

“You were out of work.” he asked, finally

“I got sick,” she replied, “and after that I had no money

“Stanislovas dead.”

“Yes,” said Marija, “I forgot

“How did he die.”

“Rats killed him,” she answered

Jurgis gave a gasp

“Yes,” said the other; she was bending over, lacing her shoes as she spoke

He used to carry cans on a long pole; and he’d drink a little out of each can, and one day he drank too much, and fell asleep in a corner, and got locked up in the place all night

Jurgis sat, frozen with horror

There was a long silence

Suddenly a big policeman came to the door

“Hurry up, there,” he said

“As quick as I can,” said Marija, and she stood up and began putting on her corsets with feverish haste

“Are the rest of the people alive.” asked Jurgis, finally

“Yes,” she said

“Where are they.”

“They live not far from here

“They are working.” he inquired

“Elzbieta is,” said Marija, “when she can

Jurgis was silent for a moment

“Do they know you live here—how you live.” he asked

“Elzbieta knows,” answered Marija

And maybe the children have found out by this time

“And Tamoszius.” he asked

Marija shrugged her shoulders

“I haven’t seen him for over a year

Marija was standing in front of the glass fastening her dress

It struck fear to his heart to watch her

Then suddenly she gave a glance at him

“You look as if you had been having a rough time of it yourself,” she said

“I have,” he answered

“Where have you been.”

“All over

“I found you had gone away, no one knew where

“No,” she answered, “I don’t blame you

We didn’t stand any chance

“You’d have come here.” said Jurgis

“Yes,” she answered; “but that’s not what I meant

Jurgis was silent; he had never thought of that aspect of it

“When people are starving,” the other continued, “and they have anything with a price, they ought to sell it, I say

Ona could have taken care of us all, in the beginning.” Marija spoke without emotion, as one who had come to regard things from the business point of view

“I—yes, I guess so,” Jurgis answered hesitatingly

He did not add that he had paid three hundred dollars, and a foreman’s job, for the satisfaction of knocking down “Phil” Connor a second time

The policeman came to the door again just then

“Come on, now,” he said

“All right,” said Marija, reaching for her hat, which was big enough to be a drum major’s, and full of ostrich feathers

She went out into the hall and Jurgis followed, the policeman remaining to look under the bed and behind the door

“What’s going to come of this.” Jurgis asked, as they started down the steps

“The raid, you mean

Anyhow, they won’t do anything to you

“Maybe so,” he responded, “but not me—I’m afraid I’m in for it.”

“How do you mean.”

“I’m wanted by the police,” he said, lowering his voice, though of course their conversation was in Lithuanian

“Hell.” said Marija

“That’s too bad

Downstairs, where the greater part of the prisoners were now massed, she sought out the stout personage with the diamond earrings, and had a few whispered words with her

He’d just got in the door when you knocked

The sergeant laughed as he looked at Jurgis

So Jurgis slunk in among the rest of the men, who kept dodging behind each other like sheep that have smelled a wolf

There were old men and young men, college boys and gray-beards old enough to be their grandfathers; some of them wore evening dress—there was no one among them save Jurgis who showed any signs of poverty

When the roundup was completed, the doors were opened and the party marched out

At the station house Jurgis gave a Polish name and was put into a cell with half a dozen others; and while these sat and talked in whispers, he lay down in a corner and gave himself up to his thoughts

Jurgis had looked into the deepest reaches of the social pit, and grown used to the sights in them

Now and then he would quiver with a sudden spasm of horror, at the picture of little Stanislovas shut up in the deserted building and fighting for his life with the rats

All these emotions had become strangers to the soul of Jurgis; it was so long since they had troubled him that he had ceased to think they might ever trouble him again

Their voices would die, and never again would he hear them—and so the last faint spark of manhood in his soul would flicker out

CHAPTER XXVIII

After breakfast Jurgis was driven to the court, which was crowded with the prisoners and those who had come out of curiosity or in the hope of recognizing one of the men and getting a case for blackmail

Meantime, he listened to the story of how Jurgis had been looking for his sister, and advised him dryly to keep his sister in a better place; then he let him go, and proceeded to fine each of the girls five dollars, which fines were paid in a bunch from a wad of bills which Madame Polly extracted from her stocking

Jurgis waited outside and walked home with Marija

By daylight, Jurgis was able to observe that the color on her cheeks was not the old natural one of abounding health; her complexion was in reality a parchment yellow, and there were black rings under her eyes

“Have you been sick.” he asked

“Sick.” she said

She fell silent for a moment, staring ahead of her gloomily

“It’s morphine,” she said, at last

“What’s that for.” he asked

“It’s the way of it; I don’t know why

And the madame always gives them dope when they first come, and they learn to like it; or else they take it for headaches and such things, and get the habit that way

“How long are you going to stay.” he asked

“I don’t know,” she said

“Always, I guess

“Don’t you save any money.”

“Save.” said Marija

I either have to stand it or quit, and it would be the same anywhere else

Marija sat brooding in silence for a while; then, seeing that Jurgis was interested, she went on: “That’s the way they keep the girls—they let them run up debts, so they can’t get away

Often, too, they are girls that didn’t know what they were coming to, that had hired out for housework

Jurgis answered in the affirmative

“Well, she came to America about a year ago

Only one of the girls that came out with her got away, and she jumped out of a second-story window one night

“I did,” said Jurgis, “I heard of it afterward.” (It had happened in the place where he and Duane had taken refuge from their “country customer.” The girl had become insane, fortunately for the police.)

“There’s lots of money in it,” said Marija—“they get as much as forty dollars a head for girls, and they bring them from all over

French girls are bad, too, the worst of all, except for the Japanese

Marija paused for a moment or two, and then she added: “Most of the women here are pretty decent—you’d be surprised

“Some of them say they do,” said Jurgis

“I know,” said she; “they say anything

But they didn’t like it when they began—you’d find out—it’s always misery

Marija sat for a minute or two, brooding somberly

“Tell me about yourself, Jurgis,” she said, suddenly

So he told her the long story of his adventures since his flight from home; his life as a tramp, and his work in the freight tunnels, and the accident; and then of Jack Duane, and of his political career in the stockyards, and his downfall and subsequent failures

“You found me just in the nick of time,” she said

“I don’t like to let you—” he began

“Why not

“No, not that,” he said

“Nonsense.” said Marija

“Don’t think about it

“You must be hungry,” she said, after a minute or two

She pressed a button, and a colored woman came to the door and took her order

“It’s nice to have somebody to wait on you,” she observed, with a laugh, as she lay back on the bed

As the prison breakfast had not been liberal, Jurgis had a good appetite, and they had a little feast together, talking meanwhile of Elzbieta and the children and old times

Shortly before they were through, there came another colored girl, with the message that the “madame” wanted Marija—“Lithuanian Mary,” as they called her here

“That means you have to go,” she said to Jurgis

So he got up, and she gave him the new address of the family, a tenement over in the Ghetto district

“You go there,” she said

But Jurgis stood hesitating

“I—I don’t like to,” he said

“How do you need money.” was her reply

“Yes,” he said; “but then I don’t like to go there after I left them—and while I have nothing to do, and while you—you—”

“Go on.” said Marija, giving him a push

Here’s a quarter for you now, and go along, and they’ll be so glad to have you back, you won’t have time to feel ashamed

So Jurgis went out, and walked down the street to think it over

There was no one taking tickets, so it must be a free show again

He entered

If only he could get some sort of a job before he went—if that last boss had only been willing to try him

—Then suddenly Jurgis looked up

Jurgis had been behind the scenes in politics

He went back to his thoughts, but with one further fact to reckon with—that he was caught here

If Elzbieta were ugly, he would tell her that in so many words

So Jurgis went on meditating; until finally, when he had been an hour or two in the hall, there began to prepare itself a repetition of the dismal catastrophe of the night before

He caught himself many times, as usual, and made desperate resolutions; but the hall was hot and close, and his long walk and his dinner were too much for him—in the end his head sank forward and he went off again

And then again someone nudged him, and he sat up with his old terrified start

Were they going to let him alone this time

And then suddenly came a voice in his ear, a woman’s voice, gentle and sweet, “If you would try to listen, comrade, perhaps you would be interested.”

Jurgis was more startled by that than he would have been by the touch of a policeman

Who was it that called him “comrade”

He waited long, long; and at last, when he was sure that he was no longer watched, he stole a glance out of the corner of his eyes at the woman who sat beside him

She was young and beautiful; she wore fine clothes, and was what is called a “lady.” And she called him “comrade”

He turned a little, carefully, so that he could see her better; then he began to watch her, fascinated

And what sort of thing was this, anyhow.—So all at once it occurred to Jurgis to look at the speaker

It was like coming suddenly upon some wild sight of nature—a mountain forest lashed by a tempest, a ship tossed about upon a stormy sea

To hear it was to be suddenly arrested, to be gripped, transfixed

“You listen to these things,” the man was saying, “and you say, ‘Yes, they are true, but they have been that way always.’ Or you say, ‘Maybe it will come, but not in my time—it will not help me.’ And so you return to your daily round of toil, you go back to be ground up for profits in the world-wide mill of economic might

With the voice of humanity, calling for deliverance

The speaker paused

Through it all Jurgis sat still, motionless and rigid, his eyes fixed upon the speaker; he was trembling, smitten with wonder

Suddenly the man raised his hands, and silence fell, and he began again

“I plead with you,” he said, “whoever you may be, provided that you care about the truth; but most of all I plead with working-man, with those to whom the evils I portray are not mere matters of sentiment, to be dallied and toyed with, and then perhaps put aside and forgotten—to whom they are the grim and relentless realities of the daily grind, the chains upon their limbs, the lash upon their backs, the iron in their souls

And we know it, and read of it, and take it for granted; our papers tell of it, and the presses are not stopped—our churches know of it, and do not close their doors—the people behold it, and do not rise up in horror and revolution

“Or perhaps Manchuria is too far away for you—come home with me then, come here to Chicago

And now a dream of resistance haunts him, hope battling with fear; until suddenly he stirs, and a fetter snaps—and a thrill shoots through him, to the farthest ends of his huge body, and in a flash the dream becomes an act

And the speaker’s voice broke suddenly, with the stress of his feelings; he stood with his arms stretched out above him, and the power of his vision seemed to lift him from the floor

By God

CHAPTER XXIX

The man had gone back to a seat upon the platform, and Jurgis realized that his speech was over

Here were men who would show him and help him; and he would have friends and allies, he would dwell in the sight of justice, and walk arm in arm with power

The audience subsided again, and Jurgis sat back

Jurgis heard; but he had not a penny to give, and so his thoughts went elsewhere again

He kept his eyes fixed on the orator, who sat in an armchair, his head leaning on his hand and his attitude indicating exhaustion

And now he began to realize again that he was a “hobo,” that he was ragged and dirty, and smelled bad, and had no place to sleep that night

And so, at last, when the meeting broke up, and the audience started to leave, poor Jurgis was in an agony of uncertainty

He would not despise him, tramp as he was

So he stepped into an empty row of seats and watched, and when the crowd had thinned out, he started toward the platform

The orator sat in a chair, with his shoulders sunk together and his eyes half closed; his face was ghastly pale, almost greenish in hue, and one arm lay limp at his side

So Jurgis stood watching, while five or ten minutes passed

He stepped forward

“I wanted to thank you, sir.” he began, in breathless haste

“I could not go away without telling you how much—how glad I am I heard you

The big man with the spectacles, who had moved away, came back at this moment

“The comrade is too tired to talk to any one—” he began; but the other held up his hand

“Wait,” he said

“You want to know more about Socialism.” he asked

Jurgis started

I want to know about what you spoke of—I want to help

“Where do you live.” asked the other

“I have no home,” said Jurgis, “I am out of work.”

“You are a foreigner, are you not.”

“Lithuanian, sir.”

The man thought for a moment, and then turned to his friend

“Who is there, Walters.” he asked

“Ostrinski speaks Lithuanian,” said the other

The other started away, and the speaker looked at Jurgis again

“I am just tired out—I have spoken every day for the last month

The messenger had had to go no further than the door, he came back, followed by a man whom he introduced to Jurgis as “Comrade Ostrinski.” Comrade Ostrinski was a little man, scarcely up to Jurgis’s shoulder, wizened and wrinkled, very ugly, and slightly lame

But his handclasp was hearty, and he spoke in Lithuanian, which warmed Jurgis to him

“You want to know about Socialism.” he said

“Surely

And so Jurgis bade farewell to the master wizard, and went out

“You have been through the mill, comrade.” he said

Then Ostrinski in turn explained his circumstances

“Perhaps tomorrow we can do better,” said Ostrinski

Ostrinski’s home was in the Ghetto district, where he had two rooms in the basement of a tenement

Chicago was the industrial center of the country, and nowhere else were the unions so strong; but their organizations did the workers little good, for the employers were organized, also; and so the strikes generally failed, and as fast as the unions were broken up the men were coming over to the Socialists

Ostrinski explained the organization of the party, the machinery by which the proletariat was educating itself

All this was the growth of the last few years—there had been almost nothing of it when Ostrinski first came to Chicago

Ostrinski was a Pole, about fifty years of age

said Ostrinski

The little tailor sat tilted back in his stiff kitchen chair, with his feet stretched out upon the empty stove, and speaking in low whispers, so as not to waken those in the next room

That all this wonderful machinery of progress had been created by his fellows—Jurgis could not believe it, it seemed too good to be true

That was always the way, said Ostrinski; when a man was first converted to Socialism he was like a crazy person—he could not understand how others could fail to see it, and he expected to convert all the world the first week

So far, the rule in America had been that one Socialist made another Socialist once every two years; and if they should maintain the same rate they would carry the country in 1912—though not all of them expected to succeed as quickly as that

The Socialists were organized in every civilized nation; it was an international political party, said Ostrinski, the greatest the world had ever known

It was the new religion of humanity—or you might say it was the fulfillment of the old religion, since it implied but the literal application of all the teachings of Christ

Until long after midnight Jurgis sat lost in the conversation of his new acquaintance

It was long after midnight when Jurgis lay down upon the floor of Ostrinski’s kitchen; and yet it was an hour before he could get to sleep, for the glory of that joyful vision of the people of Packingtown marching in and taking possession of the Union Stockyards

CHAPTER XXX

Jurgis had breakfast with Ostrinski and his family, and then he went home to Elzbieta

She agreed in everything with Jurgis, except the need of his paying his dues; and she would even go to a meeting with him now and then, and sit and plan her next day’s dinner amid the storm

For a week after he became a convert Jurgis continued to wander about all day, looking for work; until at last he met with a strange fortune

A man he took for the proprietor was standing in the lobby, and he went up to him and tackled him for a job

“What can you do.” the man asked

“Anything, sir,” said Jurgis, and added quickly: “I’ve been out of work for a long time, sir

The other was eying him narrowly

“Do you drink.” he asked

“No, sir,” said Jurgis

“Well, I’ve been employing a man as a porter, and he drinks

I’ve discharged him seven times now, and I’ve about made up my mind that’s enough

“Yes, sir.”

“It’s hard work

“I’m willing, sir.”

“All right

I’ll pay you thirty a month and board, and you can begin now, if you feel like it

And so Jurgis fell to work, and toiled like a Trojan till night

Then he went and told Elzbieta, and also, late as it was, he paid a visit to Ostrinski to let him know of his good fortune

“Yes,” said Jurgis, “that’s the name.”

To which the other replied, “Then you’ve got the best boss in Chicago—he’s a state organizer of our party, and one of our best-known speakers.”

So the next morning Jurgis went to his employer and told him; and the man seized him by the hand and shook it

“By Jove.” he cried, “that lets me out

So, after that, Jurgis was known to his “boss” as “Comrade Jurgis,” and in return he was expected to call him “Comrade Hinds.” “Tommy” Hinds, as he was known to his intimates, was a squat little man, with broad shoulders and a florid face, decorated with gray side whiskers

He was a great fellow to jolly along a crowd, and would keep a meeting in an uproar; when once he got really waked up, the torrent of his eloquence could be compared with nothing save Niagara

Tommy Hinds had begun life as a blacksmith’s helper, and had run away to join the Union army, where he had made his first acquaintance with “graft,” in the shape of rotten muskets and shoddy blankets

Whenever it rained, the rheumatism would get into his joints, and then he would screw up his face and mutter: “Capitalism, my boy, capitalism

Tommy Hinds had set out upon the trail of the Octopus as soon as the war was over

Finally, Tommy Hinds had revealed to him the wonderful idea of using the trusts instead of destroying them, and he had sold his farm and come to Chicago

That was Amos Struver; and then there was Harry Adams, the assistant clerk, a pale, scholarly-looking man, who came from Massachusetts, of Pilgrim stock

He was a studious man, reserved, and nothing of an orator; but he always had a pile of books under his desk in the hotel, and articles from his pen were beginning to attract attention in the party press

Contrary to what one would have expected, all this radicalism did not hurt the hotel business; the radicals flocked to it, and the commercial travelers all found it diverting

“See here,” he would say, in the middle of an argument, “I’ve got a fellow right here in my place who’s worked there and seen every bit of it.” And then Jurgis would drop his work, whatever it was, and come, and the other would say, “Comrade Jurgis, just tell these gentlemen what you saw on the killing-beds.” At first this request caused poor Jurgis the most acute agony, and it was like pulling teeth to get him to talk; but gradually he found out what was wanted, and in the end he learned to stand up and speak his piece with enthusiasm

And then the hotel-keeper would go on to show how the Socialists had the only real remedy for such evils, how they alone “meant business” with the Beef Trust

The newspapers ridicule the authors, the churches defend the criminals, and the government—does nothing

Here the other would generally admit that he was “stuck”; and Tommy Hinds would explain to him, and it was fun to see his eyes open

The Beef Trust has defied the railroads—it is plundering them day by day through the Private Car; and so the public is roused to fury, and the papers clamor for action, and the government goes on the war-path

Such was the new home in which Jurgis lived and worked, and in which his education was completed

He met some neighbors with whom Elzbieta had made friends in her neighborhood, and he set out to make Socialists of them by wholesale, and several times he all but got into a fight

It was all so painfully obvious to Jurgis

Was it not honestly a trial to listen to an argument such as that

And yet there were things even worse

And they really thought that it was “individualism” for tens of thousands of them to herd together and obey the orders of a steel magnate, and produce hundreds of millions of dollars of wealth for him, and then let him give them libraries; while for them to take the industry, and run it to suit themselves, and build their own libraries—that would have been “Paternalism”

Sometimes the agony of such things as this was almost more than Jurgis could bear; yet there was no way of escape from it, there was nothing to do but to dig away at the base of this mountain of ignorance and prejudice

And the rest of the time you must sharpen up your weapons—you must think out new replies to his objections, and provide yourself with new facts to prove to him the folly of his ways

So Jurgis acquired the reading habit

These discussed the political situation from every point of view, and all that troubled Jurgis was the impossibility of carrying off but a small part of the treasures they offered him

There was a man who was known in the party as the “Little Giant.” The Lord had used up so much material in the making of his head that there had not been enough to complete his legs; but he got about on the platform, and when he shook his raven whiskers the pillars of capitalism rocked

The inevitability of the revolution depended upon this fact, that they had no choice but to unite or be exterminated; this fact, grim and inexorable, depended upon no human will, it was the law of the economic process, of which the editor showed the details with the most marvelous precision

And later on came the evening of the great meeting of the campaign, when Jurgis heard the two standard-bearers of his party

His voice was husky from much speaking, but the great auditorium was as still as death, and every one heard him

And then, as Jurgis came out from this meeting, some one handed him a paper which he carried home with him and read; and so he became acquainted with the “Appeal to Reason.” About twelve years previously a Colorado real-estate speculator had made up his mind that it was wrong to gamble in the necessities of life of human beings: and so he had retired and begun the publication of a Socialist weekly

It was a four-page weekly, which sold for less than half a cent a copy; its regular subscription list was a quarter of a million, and it went to every crossroads post office in America

The “Appeal” was a “propaganda” paper

He was a prominent opponent of Socialism, which he said would break up the home.” The “Appeal” had what it called its “Army,” about thirty thousand of the faithful, who did things for it; and it was always exhorting the “Army” to keep its dander up, and occasionally encouraging it with a prize competition, for anything from a gold watch to a private yacht or an eighty-acre farm

But sometimes, again, the “Appeal” would be desperately serious

Jurgis had resolved not to go near his old home again, but when he heard of this it was too much for him, and every night for a week he would get on the car and ride out to the stockyards, and help to undo his work of the previous year, when he had sent Mike Scully’s ten-pin setter to the city Board of Aldermen

It was quite marvelous to see what a difference twelve months had made in Packingtown—the eyes of the people were getting opened

And he would have told the “pitchfork senator” all his experiences, had not Harry Adams and a friend grabbed him about the neck and shoved him into a seat

CHAPTER XXXI

One of the first things that Jurgis had done after he got a job was to go and see Marija

But Marija only shook her head

I’m no good—I take dope

“Can’t you stop.” Jurgis cried

“No,” she answered, “I’ll never stop

So he went, disappointed and sad

Poor Jurgis was not very happy in his home-life

Never in all his life did Jurgis forget the day before election, when there came a telephone message from a friend of Harry Adams, asking him to bring Jurgis to see him that night; and Jurgis went, and met one of the minds of the movement

The invitation was from a man named Fisher, a Chicago millionaire who had given up his life to settlement work, and had a little home in the heart of the city’s slums

The millionaire suggested that Adams bring Jurgis along, and then start up the subject of “pure food,” in which the editor was interested

Young Fisher’s home was a little two-story brick house, dingy and weather-beaten outside, but attractive within

He was terrified lest they should expect him to talk

There was the host himself, a tall, athletic young man, clad in evening dress, as also was the editor, a dyspeptic-looking gentleman named Maynard

There were two other men, whom young Fisher had introduced to Jurgis as Mr Lucas and Mr Schliemann; he heard them address Adams as “Comrade,” and so he knew that they were Socialists

The one called Lucas was a mild and meek-looking little gentleman of clerical aspect; he had been an itinerant evangelist, it transpired, and had seen the light and become a prophet of the new dispensation

Jurgis was soon sitting spellbound, thinking that here was surely the strangest man that had ever lived in the world

Nicholas Schliemann was a Swede, a tall, gaunt person, with hairy hands and bristling yellow beard; he was a university man, and had been a professor of philosophy—until, as he said, he had found that he was selling his character as well as his time

That was the nearest approach to independence a man could make “under capitalism,” he explained; he would never marry, for no sane man would allow himself to fall in love until after the revolution

He sat in a big arm-chair, with his legs crossed, and his head so far in the shadow that one saw only two glowing lights, reflected from the fire on the hearth

He was carried over the difficult places in spite of himself; and he went plunging away in mad career—a very Mazeppa-ride upon the wild horse Speculation

Nicholas Schliemann was familiar with all the universe, and with man as a small part of it

The working-man was to fix his hopes upon a future life, while his pockets were picked in this one; he was brought up to frugality, humility, obedience—in short to all the pseudo-virtues of capitalism

And here the ex-preacher entered the field, and there was a lively tussle

And what was the use, he asked, of confusing Religion with men’s perversions of it

“Ah, yes,” said the other, “of course, I have no doubt that in a hundred years the Vatican will be denying that it ever opposed Socialism, just as at present it denies that it ever tortured Galileo.”

“I am not defending the Vatican,” exclaimed Lucas, vehemently

Take the twenty-fourth chapter of the Book of Job, which I am accustomed to quote in my addresses as ‘the Bible upon the Beef Trust’; or take the words of Isaiah—or of the Master himself

“I will grant you Jesus,” interrupted the other

“Well, then,” cried Lucas, “and why should Jesus have nothing to do with his church—why should his words and his life be of no authority among those who profess to adore him

And this man they have made into the high priest of property and smug respectability, a divine sanction of all the horrors and abominations of modern commercial civilization

“Bravo.” cried Schliemann, laughing

Do you not know that if he were in St

Here the speaker paused an instant for breath

“No, comrade,” said the other, dryly, “for he was a practical man

Lucas waited until the company had stopped laughing over this; then he began again: “But look at it from the point of view of practical politics, comrade

We have his words, which no one can deny; and shall we not quote them to the people, and prove to them what he was, and what he taught, and what he did

Lucas halted again; and the other stretched out his hand to a paper on the table

An eminent and scholarly bishop

To this little passage of arms the rest of the company sat as spectators

Also the artist’s audience of the present was a small minority of people, all debased and vulgarized by the effort it had cost them to win in the commercial battle, of the intellectual and artistic activities which would result when the whole of mankind was set free from the nightmare of competition, we could at present form no conception whatever

And then the editor wanted to know upon what ground Dr Schliemann asserted that it might be possible for a society to exist upon an hour’s toil by each of its members

After the triumph of the international proletariat, war would of course be inconceivable; and who can figure the cost of war to humanity—not merely the value of the lives and the material that it destroys, not merely the cost of keeping millions of men in idleness, of arming and equipping them for battle and parade, but the drain upon the vital energies of society by the war attitude and the war terror, the brutality and ignorance, the drunkenness, prostitution, and crime it entails, the industrial impotence and the moral deadness

And then Schliemann went on to outline some of the wastes of competition: the losses of industrial warfare; the ceaseless worry and friction; the vices—such as drink, for instance, the use of which had nearly doubled in twenty years, as a consequence of the intensification of the economic struggle; the idle and unproductive members of the community, the frivolous rich and the pauperized poor; the law and the whole machinery of repression; the wastes of social ostentation, the milliners and tailors, the hairdressers, dancing masters, chefs and lackeys

And then consider that, added to this competition in display, you have, like oil on the flames, a whole system of competition in selling

“And don’t forget the wastes of fraud,” put in young Fisher

“When one comes to the ultra-modern profession of advertising,” responded Schliemann—“the science of persuading people to buy what they do not want—he is in the very center of the ghastly charnel house of capitalist destructiveness, and he scarcely knows which of a dozen horrors to point out first

But consider the waste in time and energy incidental to making ten thousand varieties of a thing for purposes of ostentation and snobbishness, where one variety would do for use

“And consider the moral aspects of the thing,” put in the ex-preacher

“Precisely,” said Schliemann; “the low knavery and the ferocious cruelty incidental to them, the plotting and the lying and the bribing, the blustering and bragging, the screaming egotism, the hurrying and worrying

Consider the wastes incidental to the crowding into cities, made necessary by competition and by monopoly railroad rates; consider the slums, the bad air, the disease and the waste of vital energies; consider the office buildings, the waste of time and material in the piling of story upon story, and the burrowing underground

“I do not follow that,” said the editor

There is also a universal government bulletin, in which are listed and precisely described everything which the commonwealth has for sale

“How is the price of an article determined.”

“The price is the labor it has cost to make and deliver it, and it is determined by the first principles of arithmetic

The million workers in the nation’s wheat fields have worked a hundred days each, and the total product of the labor is a billion bushels, so the value of a bushel of wheat is the tenth part of a farm labor-day

“You say ‘for farm work,’” said Mr Maynard

“Manifestly not, since some work is easy and some hard, and we should have millions of rural mail carriers, and no coal miners

Of course the wages may be left the same, and the hours varied; one or the other will have to be varied continually, according as a greater or less number of workers is needed in any particular industry

“How about those occupations in which time is difficult to calculate

“Obviously it is the labor cost of the paper, printing, and binding of it—about a fifth of its present cost.”

“And the author.”

“I have already said that the state could not control intellectual production

In the same way there are magazines about Egyptian coins, and Catholic saints, and flying machines, and athletic records, and I know nothing about any of them

Dr Schliemann paused for a moment

“What else is there.” asked Maynard

“I have pointed out some of the negative wastes of competition,” answered the other

To picture the harvest fields of the future, to which millions of happy men and women come for a summer holiday, brought by special trains, the exactly needful number to each place

Dr Schliemann paused a moment

And then again, it has been proven that meat is unnecessary as a food; and meat is obviously more difficult to produce than vegetable food, less pleasant to prepare and handle, and more likely to be unclean

“How would Socialism change that.” asked the girl-student, quickly

It was the first time she had spoken

“So long as we have wage slavery,” answered Schliemann, “it matters not in the least how debasing and repulsive a task may be, it is easy to find people to perform it

They are penned up in filthy houses and left to rot and stew in misery, and the conditions of their life make them ill faster than all the doctors in the world could heal them; and so, of course, they remain as centers of contagion, poisoning the lives of all of us, and making happiness impossible for even the most selfish

And here the Herr Doctor relapsed into silence again

Jurgis would have liked to talk to her, he felt sure that she would have understood him

And only a few hours after this came election day—when the long campaign was over, and the whole country seemed to stand still and hold its breath, awaiting the issue

Jurgis and the rest of the staff of Hinds’s Hotel could hardly stop to finish their dinner, before they hurried off to the big hall which the party had hired for that evening

But already there were people waiting, and already the telegraph instrument on the stage had begun clicking off the returns

Battle Creek, Michigan, from 4,261 to 10,184; that was the answer of labor to the Citizens’ Alliance Movement

And then there were official returns from the various precincts and wards of the city itself

Thus Chicago now led the country; it had set a new standard for the party, it had shown the workingmen the way

—So spoke an orator upon the platform; and two thousand pairs of eyes were fixed upon him, and two thousand voices were cheering his every sentence

We shall bear down the opposition, we shall sweep if before us—and _Chicago will be ours._ Chicago will be ours
